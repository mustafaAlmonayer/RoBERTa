I ordered a full rack of ribs with deep fried corn and green beans.  The deep fried corn was awesome but I was pretty dissapointed in the ribs.  I'm not sure if it was because I came later in the day around 6 pm (shouldn't matter) but my ribs were pretty dry.  I've had my fair share of dry rub ribs and expect them to still be tender and moist.  My travel partners were also not too impressed with the ribs from Pappy's.  Maybe it was an off day for them, but this is definitely not close to the best ribs that I've had.",unhelpful,0,1

He spent extra time on our carpets, since we were putting our house up for sale, and made them look new.  I've had other carpet cleaners out, and they were interested in just getting in and out as fast as they could, not in doing a thorough job like Todd did.  

On my stairs, he said if I wasn't happy when he was through, I didn't have to pay him for the stairs.  I was super satisfied, and I think the stairs look as good as they did when they were new.

Everything is just so damn salty here. The fried pickles were too thing, batter way too salty.  Fries not crispy enough. Portions vary wildly from order to order for the sides. 

The po'boys were pretty big with alot of seafood on them. Thought the coating was way too salty though, and they were cooked a tad too long. Plus the bread was a bit too chewy.  Not enough tomatoes or lettuce as well.

The beef gravy on my fries was good though. Best thing there. I might give this place 1 more try to get the roast beef po'boy, which I guess is what they are known for really. Just didn't think the seafood stuff was that great.

17,657859921a6d2c7052a6478b,"I went here for a show at 9:45pm featuring Mike Vecchione. Even at this time, there were still a lot of people in venue in and around Punch Line Philly. The staff were all nice and friendly. The venue itself was very intimate and small. I sat in a table of 6 near the right side of the stage. Anywhere you sat, you can see the stage clearly. 

In terms of food, I got popcorn shrimp as my appetizer. It was priced at $12, but there was a good amount so I had to take some home. The shrimp was small bite-sized and the sauce complemented well with it.

There was a minimum of 2 drinks we had to order, that could be non-alcoholic beverages as well. First one I got was their special cocktail for the night, which was a watermelon slush cocktail ($10). It came in a large cup and took the whole show to drink. I like sweet and fruity drinks, and this cocktail fit the bill so I was satisfied with the taste. The waitress came around near the end and told me I hadn't satisfied the 2 drink minimum and asked what else I wanted. I asked for a water bottle but I didn't expect $5 for it.

Overall, the show itself was pretty funny. This was my first comedy show so I didn't really know what I was expecting but the 2 opening acts and Mike Vecchione were entertaining. In the end, there was a chance to meet and take pictures with Mike Vecchione, which was a nice opportunity to convey our thoughts about the show.

18,657855651a6d2c7052a63ea4,"Possibly the best Italian food I've eaten so far in Philadelphia. Higher in class (mostly meaning price) than Giorgio on Pine and higher in caliber (mostly meaning taste) than the likes of La Viola, etc., Nina's Trattoria is a hidden gem amongst the street vendors on 9th and Christian. 

I will admit that the service was not the best. There was one waitress for the restaurant, and I understand how things can get hectic- but that's not an excuse to throw silverware onto the table or haphazardly collect appetizer plates with clinks and clangs. I had to find my own wine opener for the bottle of Malbec that I brought (BYOB, holla!) after waiting for almost 10 minutes and no pour in sight. While I was debating on what appetizer to order, she simply left before I could let her know what I decided on. I think investing in a second waitress for Friday and Saturday evenings might curb the brusque attitude of the one server. 

Anyway- the food was most excellent. The stuffed mushrooms came in a pair to start (at $6, I think four would have been more price-appropriate) and were piping hot, stuffed with moist breadcrumbs and topped with red sauce. We were also served warm, flaky, knotted rolls with olive oil and parmesan cheese. 

I had the eggplant parmesan for my entree, which melted in my mouth. The sauce was smooth, not too sweet, and plentiful. I do wish that it had been served over some pasta, especially at the price ($19). When I mentioned this to the owner after he asked me how my meal was, he told me that some people ask pasta to go with it and they give it to them, no problem. Noted. 

 My boyfriend had the linguine with arugula and shrimp ($23), which was divine. Buttery, flavorful shrimp over fresh pasta- it was so good I was stealing bites by the twisted forkful. And most importantly, it was not too garlicky. The waitress came by with more rolls as if she knew we wanted to soak up the leftovers. 

Go for the food, and try to embrace the service as best you can.",helpful,1,0

I saw the server approach a lady talking on her cell phone in the corner then motion to the table.  She never really appeared to acknowledge the server but just sort of stomped past her to the table still talking on her cell phone.  After she approached the table I heard her tell the person on the phone to hold on a minute then without even taking the phone away from her ear she looked at the customer and just said 'yeah?'.  Didn't introduce herself, no 'How can I help you?', nothing, just 'yeah?'.  At that point my server returned with my change and I tipped her, and left as quick as I could.

I hadn't been here in several years, but I remembered it to be good and I wasn't wrong.

It was slam packed inside (always a good sign) but we were lucky to find three seats at the bar within ear shot of the Irish Duo that was performing.
We all ordered a beer (the Guinness here tastes like it does in Ireland, apparently this place keeps it fresh and cleans their lines regularly.) and enjoyed the fantastic music until our food came out. I had the Steak and Guinness Pie, which was hearty and delicious. If you're not a fan of salty or rich foods I would avoid this, but it was right up my alley.
My friends had the corned beef and cabbage and the salmon patties with corn and potatoes.
Both were great and huge portions (of course I had to try their food), but the salmon patties were off the charts good (it was recommended by the bartender, so no surprise.)
I live on the far other side of town from here, but I will be back sooner rather than later for those patties. They're more like a crab cake than the salmon patties I grew up on.

I knew nothing about med spas, but found Strella through a simple internet search. I am glad I found Strella.

So, I had a bunch of these things called Cherry Angiomas on my face (some on arm) that I wanted to get rid of. Cherry Angiomas look sorta like red pen marks. Dots basically. I wanted them off. When I inquired through Strella, I quickly got an email back saying ""yes"" they do laser them off. I then received a very nice phone call from somebody who works there explaining the procedure to me and setting up the appointment. 

From the get-go, Strella was *very* professional, and treated me with the upmost respect. Again, being a guy, I almost expected them to treat me differently. I was wrong. I received a nice phone call just before to remind me of my appointment, and ask if I needed directions. Upon arrival for my appointment, I was quickly greeted in a friendly manner, and even was offered water. I was explained the procedure and had my questions answered like I was the only one there. When I picked up a brochure for a different procedure and mentioned it would be for my wife, I was given an overview of that procedure, and another brochure to bring home. 

The technician zapping off those pesky red dots was also very friendly. For the entire appointment, me being comfortable was there top priority. 

As for the zapping of those cherry angiomas, it was a quick procedure with fantastic results. And the price was very fair, and reasonable.

In addition to their great massages they also have some hand made balms and oils and such made by one of the therapists! So, you really get to support a local business and local people by patronizing this place!

The service is truly top notch! The only thing that brings it down a star is that the soundproofing isn't great in there. You can frequently hear road traffic and in at least some of the rooms you can hear the toilet flushing in the bathroom which is clearly not the most relaxing of sounds lol.

Not sure what happened...

Positives:
Clean and cute restrooms. 
Restaurant was clean. FYI - it is VERY warm though. Usually I'm cold everywhere. Not here. 
Server was polite. 

Here's our dilemma:
My hubby ordered the vegetarian ramen. A few minutes later the server came back and said they didn't have some of the ingredients so he ordered a different ramen. Out of curiosity, we wondered what ingredients were unavailable in hopes we could just nix them from the dish and still try that particular ramen. Hubby motions the server and server proceeds to forward our question to the chef. The chef was short and I'm not referring to verticalness. Server relays the message, they have none of the ingredients. Okay go back to the backup Ramen. No biggie. 

Our ramen arrived. I asked for a fork and they brought the cutest little spork I've ever seen! Really, it's cute! 

After getting past the sporks cuteness factor I dive into my spicy miso ramen. My hubby dives into whatever his backup ramen was. Here's where things just didn't stand a chance at good and there's no recovery. I can get past most things. Greasy/oily food I can't. Neither can the hubby. Both ramens were greasy to the point of inedible. 

No recovery and no returning for do overs. Just no. 

I'm not sure if it was an ""off"" thing but honestly, the cost is not so inexpensive that you feel comfortable brushing the possibility of bad off your shoulders. If it were edible, I'd rate it as somewhat inexpensive. Having to dine elsewhere after paying for food that you can't eat doesn't make it 'feasible' anywhere though.

Today I called to schedule that massage. 
I was promptly told that they don't currently have their license to perform massages.  WHAT?!?! 
I asked  why they took my husbands money for a service that they can't perform. 
She said that they Had their license but they are under new ownership and it ""fell through the cracks.""
Oddly enough.... what didn't ""fall through the cracks"" was their ability to take money for the massage.  
AND The Lady had no idea when they would get their licensing back!!!!! 
My question is what else ""fell through the cracks""? 
How is it that something so important could be forgotten?   
Did they let their licensing ""fall through the cracks"" to be able to perform pedicures and manicures?

This apartment complex is very deceiving. It looks great on the outside but it was built with little care and extremely cheaply. We were the first people to live in our unit and since moving in we have experience the following problems:

*All smoke detectors replaced within 60 days of moving in.

*Air conditioner failed not once but TWICE needing replacement both times.

*Deadbolt lock broke and locked us into the apartment for a few hours - was told if Fire Dept was called to break the door down we would be liable for damage. This is a HUGE safety problem.

*Master bath toilet wax ring needed replaced TWICE - leaked so bad the ceiling below us needed replaced.

*Kitchen sink leaked for unknown time period and caused damage to the cabinet.

*Kitchen faucet leaked and required maintenance to repair it.

*Front gate has been inoperable for over 3 weeks. Security issue.

*Key fob for fitness center has been inoperable for over 3 weeks.

*Fire alarm was blaring for close to 2 hours before notifying residents of the issue. Management seemed unconcerned and shut down their office to go home before residents were able to get back into their unit. Complete lack of customer service and a slap in the face to residents who were displaced while waiting for the problem to be fixed. Did they offer anything for our trouble? Nope.

*Palmetto bug infestation that took over a week to have pest control take care of it. We killed 5+ palmetto bugs in 3 days.

*Management has no concern about the condition of their units or if it affects the quality of life for residents.

*Almost every person in our building has broken their lease to get out of this community. 

*Community changes ""rules"" on a weekly basis it seems. One new ""rule"" put in place was residents aren't allowed to store bicycles or plants on their balcony. Mind you the units do not have any hall/coat closets. They expect residents to keep their bikes and other items in their living room.

*Extremely thin walls and floors. EXTREMELY THIN. I can hear our neighbors turn on and off the shower, open drawers etc. You can imagine what else is heard.

*Property developer used the cheapest materials and components possible.

*Carpet is so thin that you can feel the tack strip on your bare feet when transitioning from carpet to the hard surfaces.

*Ceiling fan in master bedroom can be heard running from other side of the apartment.

*Dryer stopped working and needed serviced.

*Received a fine for a dog turd found in the bushes at the DOG PARK. However there has been trash and metal banding in the bushes by our garage for MONTHS and it has yet to be picked up. Amazing that they go looking for dog waste to charge residents but don't keep up on the trash/debris throughout the community.

Pros:
Service - everyone from the hostess to the waiter was super friendly.  The hostess held the door for us before we were even close enough to grab the knob.  The waiter talked about their concept of fresh & organic with great enthusiasm.
Food - several vegetarian options including a homemade garden burger that was very tasty.  
Drinks - a fully stocked bar with a $5 happy hour & several original cocktails to please all tastes.
Price - very very inexpensive for the amount of food you get.
Atmosphere - casual come as you are, bring the kids.  The place is cute & unpretentious - see pictures.

Cons:
Danger - Watch the floor when you walk in, it's slippery!
Noise - it's loud!  The waiter had to ask us to repeat ourselves several times & I didn't hear half of what he was saying about the specials.
Limited Wine List - for a wine bar, they have an extremely limited wine list.  I just don't understand how you can advertise yourself as a wine bar and have such a limited selection.

My girlfriend moved into a unit here and had some of her stuff moved in. An inspector deemed the apartment ""unlivable"" as the whole building is sinking into the ground (it seems that you would know about this?!). The entire floor was caving in and she has to move out. So the complex had to move her into another apartment - it was bigger, yes but an inconvenience none-the-less. As we started moving into the next apartment a pipe from the upstairs neighbors broke flooding the apartment and leaving massive holes in the ceiling (Pictured). We then requested for her to be moved into another apartment for the same price which was met with much distain from the apartment complex. They showed us one apartment that was similar that reeked of cigarette smoke and dog (which is not something we do. Smoking or dogs.) and then they showed us a 3 bed room town home that was 500 dollars more that they refused to lower the price on from 1,500 to 1,200 a month, poor customer service. On top of all of this Stephanie the property manager was ""out of town"" or ""unavailable"" through this debacle which has lasted a week (and is still Happening). We had to speak through one of her employees which was very nice and understanding but he really had no power to do anything for us.

All in all she and her roommate are stuck in an apartment with holes in the ceiling and fans blowing up into the holes of the ceiling to ""dry"" out the water.

With the possible mold that is surely to form the complex did not offer to put them up in a hotel or other living arrangement as repairs are made.

Anyways, sure this sounds picky, but this tends to happen OFTEN, usually during weekends or when they get very busy.  The customer should not be punished with cold/warm/old pizza just because they don't hire enough drivers.

In all fairness, this is a minor problem, you can easily avoid this by asking how long it will take to deliver. If they say around an hour, then be prepared to check for a cold and old pizza.

I have to say that the technicians have always been friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable.  I have no problem with their level of expertise.  My house has 2 AC units and 2 furnaces, so it ends up being about $31 a month with their home comfort club.  This in itself isn't a bad deal at all.  You also save money on future services and do not have to pay overtime fees.  

This all sounds great until you actually need service.  Their pricing is flat rate and not charged by the hour.  To replace a leaky gas shutoff valve a few months ago, which took less than 5 minutes the cost was $250!  Much higher than a minimum hourly plumber's rate.  

Today they were out doing regular maintenance on my AC units.  They quoted me $230 for a new capacitor.  This is a $20-$30 part and takes less than 10 minutes to perform the service.  If you break it down by minutes, that puts the hourly rate to change a capacitor at $1200!!!  

The kicker for me, and the reason I cancelled my home comfort club membership was as follows: They noticed that the previous homeowner's dog must have chewed off the foam insulation on the cold lines that ran from the AC units into the house.  They explained that this could lead to an ineffecient system that did not cool the home correctly.  Perfect! I asked if they carried the foam insulation on their truck and if they could install the insulation over the pipe while they were here.  Yes, he said.  That is going to cost $116.  REALLY????  (Afterwards, I went to Home Depot and purchased 6 feet of that insulation for just over $6.  I installed it in less than 5 minutes.)  After laughing at the ridiculous price of the foam insulation, he then proceeded to try and sell me ""custom fit"" air conditioning unit covers for next winter at $100 a pop.  No thank you...I'll use a $2 tarp and bungee cords.  

To me, the above prices seem astronomical.  I understand that certain companies have minimum hourly charges if you call them out for service, however, these prices were quoted for a visit they were already on and paid for!  I felt that they were trying to rip me off.  I have a feeling that this company places high pressure on their technicians to be salespeople.

I did enjoy the fries and a milkshake, but I don't think that those two things make up for the extremely lacking main part of the meal. I tried it once when it first opened and then again, maybe like a year later, and both times I was disappointed.

93,657855651a6d2c7052a6407d,"Hmmmm, some folks have had something less than Five Star experiences here. My experience was the best.

I made it (fairly) easy for the sales guy, LeRoy, an ex-law-enforcement-guy, firearms instructor and concealed carry instructor. He knows his stuff and was very friendly. I feel as though I made a friend, truly.

I was looking for a 9mm ""pocket pistol"". As is my style, I researched the crap outta this and had narrowed it down to four pistols. They had all four of 'em in stock. 

LeRoy put 'em all on the counter, side-by-side, and ""my gun"" just jumped out at me. It did not hurt that I had more-or-less decided on that one anyway, but it was very cool, very satisfying to see them all side-by-side. Consequently, I was able to confirm my choice (from the research I had done) and was reassured. I have no ""buyer's remorse"" whatsoever. I know I made the right choice.

Oh, I almost forgot, I wanted to make certain that I left with a nice concealed carry  holster. There too they had a great selection. LeRoy knew about 'em all, and he assisted me in making the right choice, which I have already ""field-tested"".

If you own pistols, you know that the purchase process is lengthy and can take some time (paperwork, background check, and all that), as it should be. So, during this time, I was roaming around the showroom and had brief encounters with other folks working there. They too were very pleasant. 

As to price, it was explained to me that they have some sort of ""price-sweeper"", which trolls the internet looking for lower prices than theirs. So, if a lower price is found at a competitor, that is the price you pay. Knowing this stopped me from running all over town shopping for price, which can be time-consuming and aggravating.

I did not use the shooting range. There was a long queue of people waiting. So, I went home with my new purchase and am very happy.

95,657855651a6d2c7052a640c0,"Alright, so after 3 failed attempts at recreating the mussels at Kemolls, the Lady and Shady Computer Guy have been pestering me to go there again.  Just to have the mussels and absolutely nothing else.

I keep refusing.  The three of us have decided, after having multiple entrees, that this place just isn't worth it.  We couldn't stress enough how just about everything we tried could be compared to far cheaper casual establishments with some ""specialties"" likening to bar food (ie: the artichoke app).

But finally, the night before Valentines, I take the Lady to Kemoll's to satisfy her mussels cravings and, despite words of warning, give it another shot at redeeming itself.

Since we've last been there, Kemoll's has since moved up to the 40th floor with some great views of St. Louis.  That, alone, might be worth coming out here.  

Of course, we have the Steamed Mussels Alla Crema again, and I seriously don't know what I'm getting wrong.  Wrong alcohol?  Too little garlic?  Not enough salt?  Should be using the exact same mussels they're using (typically going for the more common black mussels as opposed to those other ones that you have to get frozen...) Regardless, it's a fantastic dish.  Its description is ""especially recommended.""  I've read it as ""easily recommended.""

Now that this place is coupled with some amazing views, I can forgive the price a bit more.  However, I'm not going to spend more than 30 bucks on a freaking veal picatta.  

So I look for another dish that might be harder to find elsewhere I my eyes lay upon the Petto Di Pollo Conti.  Sounds interesting.  Let's order it.  The Lady just ordered another round of mussels.

Now the last time we were here, the Lady ordered the Cannelloni Alla Crema in hopes that it would be very similar to the sauce in the mussels.  It wasn't even close.  It was pretty gosh darned horrendous.

So the Chicken that I ordered HAD THE SAME EXACT SAUCE.  Only now, it had crispy prosciutto and olives added to it instead of juice from mussels and boat loads of garlic (powder?).  It was excellent, and to give the chefs credit, it wasn't just the sauce either.  The chicken breast was extremely well cooked.  This was an extreme surprise when it's practically expected to have overcooked chicken breast, even at the finer establishments.  All of a sudden I'm picturing a bit vat of this cream sauce just sitting in the kitchen at room temp just waiting to be ladled over X dish and be finished with whatever.  It made me realize that maybe I'm overcomplicating things.  Also, the description listed ""dry vermouth.""

Back to the drawing board.

I am in California and my mom is in Tennessee so I ordered flowers through FTD.com which used Lenox Village Flowers to deliver the arrangement.

I immediately contacted FTD to notify them of this issue and I am waiting to see if this situation gets fully rectified, otherwise, I will be requesting a full refund.   This florist should be ashamed of themselves for actually delivering something that looked so terrible.

100,657855651a6d2c7052a63bbf,"I really like Movie Tavern.  I do, however, want to say upfront that it's one of those places that you have to take for what it is.

It's awesome to be able to go and get a meal and a beer while watching a movie on a theater screen.  They execute on that pretty well.  The food is standard American fare: burgers, pizzas, fried chicken or shrimp, etc.  I wouldn't give any of it a ""Best of the Philly Area"" award but it's all pretty respectable... If it were a restaurant without movies, I wouldn't rave about it but it would be fine.

The seats are comfortable, and they give you enough room for your food and drinks. And the sound and projection quality are professional, if not at the bleeding technical edge.

Their system for tending to food and drink orders during the movie is pretty good... they take most orders as soon as people are seated and get food and drinks out quickly so that there's not a ton of mid-movie distraction, they have buttons at the seats to silently request servers, there are wide side aisles so that they can get to a customer's row without causing disruption, and they take reasonable steps to make the rest as quiet an unobtrusive as possible. BUT, it is an unavoidable part of the concept that there will be people eating and someone requesting another drink or an order of fries during the movie, and that will mean that there are some whispers and some people moving around. It's all set up in a way where I don't find that too distracting, but ymmv, and it's more distraction than you'd get at the AMC.

While neither the ticket prices nor the food/drink prices reach bargain levels, I've found that my total costs going to Movie Tavern come in well below what I would have spent on some other dinner and movie arrangement. Ticket prices for new releases are no more than elsewhere, and second run tickets are much less. The food and drink prices aren't marked up like theater concession stands. Plus, I'm just as happy buying less since I don't wind up piling extra concessions on top of dinner just to have something to munch/sip on during the movie.

Bought a multi day pass last time and on the first use we had a problem. A BIG problem. After a full day of day care I brought my tired dog home only to discover that he had been attacked and had large spots of dried up crusty blood on his ear. Immediately called and spoke to manager Jeremy, who apologized for the incident and for failing to make me aware of it. After hearing that the other dog was banned after the incident, I was even more upset that they hadn't told me about it. 

It isn't the injury that merits the 2 star review (after all, these things can happen no matter how vigilant the staff may be), it's the fact that they say they checked him over and still managed to miss the tears on his ear, AND that they failed to notify me, even tho it was apparently serious enough to ban the other dog. 

There was no argument when I asked for a refund of the remaining days and he did sincerely apologize so I am giving 2 stars instead of one.",helpful,1,0

Baked Scallop - to die for! It's the sh!tnits! Its served on a bed of Enoki Mushroom (which others find it to noodles), baked to perfection with a garlic-lemon mayo based sauce, similar to baked mussels topping.

Rolls: (I can go on forever, but ill only list my top 3)
Nola Roll: There's no place that can make it the way they do. It's fresh salmon, avocadoes, smelt roe, and green onions rolled in seaweed and rice then its topped off with this amazingly baked mussels and crabmeat. DELISH!
Geaux Saints Maki: (on there special list menu) spicy tuna, spicy crawfish, snowcrab avocadoes wrapped with soy paper and rice topped with fresh salmon and escolar (white tuna). YUM!
Jalapeno Madness Roll: tempura salmon, cream cheese, jalapeno wrapped inside rice and seaweed with crabsticks across the top topped off with wasabi citrus sauce(green).

Now as much as I'd like to give them 5 stars I just can't justify the prices for the chairs and cabanas.  Cabana with 2 deck chairs costs $30-$40 a day, umbrella $20. Prices go down a little bit after 2pm. You just grab an empty one and eventually some guy will show up and collect the money. Parking isn't exactly amazing either as you can try your luck for an open lot, or bite the bullet and just go into a leaking structure. Either way you can't exactly be upset at that being as it's always crowded until the afternoon. 

The water itself is AMAZING. I've been here during low and high tide and both are fun. During low tide the beach is a lot more calm but during high tide the waves are really hitting you but that just makes it even more fun. 

Aside from getting the in the water, we collected sea shells, walked down the pier and took a nap after reading my book. 

A spot where I frequently stop at is this small Tiki Bar locates east or the pier on the beach.

143,657855651a6d2c7052a63c58,"Honestly, I've waxed all over the world since 2010 and this was one of the worst waxes I've ever had. I give two stars instead of one because I believe the girl that waxed me did what she thought was a good job.

I got a full leg, brazilian and under arm (It's what I get every time, everywhere).

During the wax, my skin was not pulled taught many times, the wax strip on my legs was usually pulled up and consequently not all the way off my skin numerous times. Despite any pain that may cause, the hairs aren't removed well that way so I was left with a number of stray hairs all over my legs. The wax also stays behind when you don't pull the strip quickly and closely to the skin so there was gobs of wax left on my legs.

The brazilian was much the same but with the hard wax. Skin was not pulled taught and so when the wax was attempted to be removed it often only came half off. Ouch! She went over and over the areas to the point I actually have a bruise and I usually don't get those. I still have way too much hair down there for all the fuss.

After she was finished with my legs and brazilian she left to let me dress on the bottom half. When I stood up there was so much wax all over my legs I actually stuck my head out the door and called her back to finish the job. During the process, there were still strips of hair not removed on my legs that I had her remove and I pulled off hard wax still attached to hair from the brazilian. She offered to rewax the brazilian but after all the waxing that had already been done I didn't want to put my skin through more.

This was also the very first time in my many years of regular waxing, that my feet were not included with the full leg wax. Sometimes I'm asked if I want them waxed and sometimes they just do it, but I was not asked and it was not done. By the time we got through all the other waxing and considering how sticky I still was I decided it wasn't worth the effort to ask to have my feet waxed.

To top it off, the painful process (not the most painful wax but definitely no where close to an easy one) lasted over 2 hours. Yes, that's right...over 2 hours. I get the same thing done every place I go world wide-full leg, brazilian, under arm-and the general time is 45 minutes. Sometimes it's around an hour and sometimes you're in and out in 35 minutes if they're speed demons. 45 minutes is a good general time frame. 2 hours + is absolutely NOT!

They do take the time to tweeze (with all the hair that was left from the poor waxing, tweezing would have taken several more hours), and that takes some extra time, granted.

I went by once before and saw some young people go in dressed in typical kiddie club style.  There was a mixed crowd that evening anywhere from 20s to 40s.  The set up isn't too bad in there with the vip areas off to the side and couches in the middle with the dancefloor in the midst of all this.  The DJ was playing some modern house tunes which were to my liking.  

My disappointment was that it opened as an upscale Vodka Bar and now has gotten desperate with letting in any old person in the club.  I knew that type of mentality wouldn't last long in Edmonton given that there aren't many people in the city who either can afford those prices or are willing to dress to the nines.  Treasury was meant to be competition for the older crowd that frequents Hundred Lounge.  In the end, I can't see only see it being a rival to clubs down the street on Jasper Avenue.

She's a mutt with really long fur, and she was seriously starting to look like a disaster. I've never taken my dogs to groomers because I usually bathe them on my own, but with her fur, I had to for trimming etc.
They were really prompt, and when they came to take her back, the girl was really sweet with her- she knelt on the floor and pet her, then picked her up- I think she made my Lucy feel a lot more at ease. 
I have to say I was worried about leaving her there (she's a rescue dog so I didn't want her to feel abandoned!), but when I came back about 2.5 hours later, she came trotting out like a little princess. She was so happy and content. They even managed to get bows in her hair which she won't let me do.
I spoke with the owner and she was really nice. It seems like a really relaxed place where the animals can feel comfortable.
It cost more than getting my own hair cut (then again, I go to a rather inexpensive place relatively speaking)- but they bathed her, trimmed all of her fur including around the pads of her paws/tail/face, trimmed her nails and put the bows in-- the full spectrum. It was definitely worth it- especially to see how happy my little pup is! I'll certainly be bringing her back!",helpful,1,0

206,657859931a6d2c7052a656b0,"So, my hopes for Blue Bear working out some kinks once they had been open for a while were very solidly dashed during a recent evening with some friends.

Our two couples each had a coupon purchased through RueLaLa that included a drink, appetizer entree and dessert for each person.  We received absolutely no attitude about the fact that we were using these coupons, and that earned them a star right away.  Unfortunately, the menu was COMPLETELY different than the one online when we bought the coupons, and also the one that was online the day we had our ""meal"".  There were no longer appetizers and entrees, but instead bar snacks, salads and burgers/sandwiches.

Our server was friendly and very apologetic about the change; the second star is purely for friendly service.  We were instructed to each order a snack and a salad or sandwich/burger, which seemed like it would yield a ridiculous quantity of food.  We complied (already thinking of leftovers), and commenced our drinking and waiting.  The restaurant was actually pretty full, and they appeared to have only two bartenders, two wait staff and one cook working.  Our waiter was routinely seen sprinting around the kitchen plating food with hands that could not have been clean enough for food handling.

We ended up being there for close to four hours by the time we finally received and (mostly) consumed our food, none of which was particularly good.  We had for the ""snack"" course: wings (grocery store deli bar quality); chef's special flatbread (think school cafeteria pizza); fried pickles (not good, but the not the worst I've had); and a veggie quesadilla that was actually made with an herb and garlic sandwich wrap!  Our ""entrees"" included: a mediocre buffalo chicken sandwich; a mediocre BLT; BBQ sliders that had to be taken apart to eat; and a cheeseburger that was served gummy, purple and raw in the middle.  We also shared an order of badly burned french fries.  The dessert of Philly Pudding ""chocolate caramel with a pretzel crust"" was a thin, warm-ish over-sweet disappointment with some pretzel crumbs tossed in.

Let's begin with making the BRIDE CRY !!! Have you ever heard of such a thing !? The day we stopped by to make our final payment we overheard one of the garden staff members (the volunteer help) say there was going to be construction in September... mind you that is my wedding month. So I asked one of the volunteers ""the one in charge""  if the construction was going on during the week of my wedding. She just walked on past me as if she didn't notice me, completely rude, when I chased her into the garden... CHASE DOWN, she rudely told me ""I am just a volunteer I don't have to talk to the bride!"" I instantly started CRYING in complete shock of the disrespect I was receiving while we were was a paying our last payment. My amazing husband, saw me crying and complained to Bridget (the director of the venue). Her response "" The volunteers are really not good with customer service.""

What a happy moment when I realized my favorite layover haunt from IAD is now in PHL, and in an expanded form. Not just a wine bar, but a larger seating area plus outside ""patio"" overlooking the Philadelphia Marketplace and the peoplemovers. Yes, you *can* get a cheesesteak there, but it's overpriced and not as authentic as it should be. There's the Independence brewpub, but beer + food can make for rougher flying in cramped and strapped-down conditions. Ah, but wine and small plates is perfect.

I skipped the salad this time and went for a full bowl of chorizo and chick pea chili. It was excellent--rich and spicy, served with crostini, and complemented well by the rich ""Autumn Flight"" of white and red wines. I also found a new favorite wine in that flight: a Columbia Valley red blend that was aggressive and tasty as hell. Yeah, I'll have a second glass of that. The snacks and salads were updated since my last visit, and all looked good. It's expensive, sure (a real dinner would have paired the $12 chili with at least a $6-$8 salad and maybe something else), but shit, it's an airport: you're once again trapped inside a crowded but strangely limited shopping mall, forced to pay whatever prices and eat whatever crap the local port authority deems kickback-worthy--and people with guns threaten you if you complain too much. At least this establishment is a place you'd want to patronize outside of localized martial law!

It's less crowded than the IAD location, and has the same comfortable leather seats. I'll call this 4.5 stars, because the lack only one amenity: a stylish but legible flight status screen.",helpful,1,0

There was 5 of us and we got into the Outback and left the burbs for some hot fried chicken.  My guests were a 40 year old couple and a 3o something couple and me.  You can tell they haven't visited too often.  We order.  I convince the hilarious guy up front to let me order it spicy.  We bicker back and forth if I can handle it.  We set up at our booth.  We wait, wait, wait, wait.  The food arrives. Smells like the delicious artery clogger that it is.  

We feast for a few minutes.  Then children run in.  Then a grandmother runs in and yells everybody get down they are shooting outside.  We hear gunshots.  What do we do? HIT  THE MOTHER EFFING DECK.  Totally felt like an episode of some horrible show they have on USA or TBS but I was so pumped to be in it.  My guests were looking a bit scared and I just could not stop laughing.   I was at this point coming from Brooklyn where lets face it isn't so gangster anymore but still pretty dangerous to Nashville and am having to hit the floor!  This is awesome. No one got hurt too which was why it was so awesome, if I saw dead bodies then this would be like 1 star don't eat here FYI.

Nonetheless, we took the rest home and finished that delicious and super friggen hot fried chicken.

Lots of space, someone cleaning the entire time you eat, nice music playing in the background and most importantly AMAZING food.

I ordered the baked chicken which comes with rice (and gravy) automatically but you also get two sides on top of that. Prepare to be FULL! The portions are large and filling for even the hungriest person. The chicken was delicious and falling off the bone. The yams were just like my mothers and the Mac and cheese was good. I stuffed my face until I could barely stand it. I washed it all down with some sweet tea that knocked my socks off.

I've tried the following tacos: Rajas con Crema, Al Pastor, and Carnitas. All are delicious; 4 small double soft-shelled tacos per order. I wish that the servings were bigger; if you're hungry, definitely order a side dish like the Mexican rice or the Totopos Y Guacamole. Some come with a small thimble of salsa verde, salsa fresca (I found the onions in the salsa fresca kinda too chunky; bring gum or breath mints for later) or guacamole (depending on which ones you order). The guacamole Y Totopos are shareable and addictive. They arrive warm and salty and irresistibly crunchy. High fives!
For drinks: I live the horchata. It's a creamy,milky drink made with a combo of ground sesame, rice,barley, or other similar ingredients. It's my favorite non-alcoholic bevvie that they serve. Refreshing and satisfying! Their version of Jamaica (a cold hibiscus iced tea) is also thirst-quenching.
I've only been here for lunch, so I can't comment on their dinner offerings. 
Parking during the weekdays is competitive and expensive. If you work or happen to be downtown, check it out if you can get there before 11:30am. Otherwise there's a line-up and they might politely ask you to free up your seat  because it gets so crazy busy there. Totally understandable but something to be aware about if you're looking for a leisurely lunch. The turnover during lunch can be very steady.
The food arrives very quickly which is great. The service is friendly and outgoing and I always feel welcome there. 
Parking in the evenings is more available. Lots of underground parking for $3 or less (for the entire evening). Also meter parking available on Jasper Ave. after 6pm, I believe.

231,657855651a6d2c7052a63b58,"I love love LOVE taquerias so I hoped this little joint would have blown me away, but I really just kind of feel ""meh"" about it.

The atmosphere is pretty cool and eclectic. As it was late and patrons already had a few drinks in them, the noisy chatter was a bit overwhelming, but not unbearable. Tables are set fairly tight, so there was a bit of puzzling through the restaurant to get to our seat while avoiding running into/over people. 

We had a late reservation (if you're going on a weekend, I highly recommend making a reservation at least several days in advance), but our party arrived about 20-30 mins early anyway, just in case, and hung out at the bar. I am unsure what time we were actually seated, but I am assuming it was a bit late as we were offered two complementary appetizers, which I found to be a nice gesture. 

We were immediately served baskets of chips and salsas, which were pretty average and on the mild side. I noticed other reviews claiming that there were plantain chips served, but I didn't find any in our baskets. Being a HUGE FAN of plantain chips, this was a little bit of a let down, but no one ever promised me plantain chips to begin with, so I got over it pretty quickly. 

Our table of eight ordered a variety of appetizers to share, including:

Guacamole- I don't want to tear apart this guac, but I am kind of a purist when it comes to avocado and feel like it was overprocessed. It tasted over seasoned, trumping the glorious mild fresh sweet nuttiness of the avocado. It was also very very creamy, where I am a chunky guac kind of girl. The rest of the table loved it though.  

Sopes-  It was probably my favorite offering of the evening, despite the heavy soggy oiliness, and I feel like the beef cheek could have been just ever so slightly more tender. It was a difficult app to share amongst several people, so I got two tiny bites in.

Empenadas- The shells were a terrific texture, crisp and firm with a tiny bit of chewiness. The filling was alright, a little on the bland side for me. I did like the mole though, nice and smokey. 

Ceviche- I did not get an opportunity to try this, but the table agreed it was ""not bad"".

Queso- Also did not get to try this, but also got a mediocre vote from the table. 

I really wanted to order the whole fish to split with hubby, however, we were being treated by his boss so we reluctantly tamed it down to tacos... darn courtesy ;)

The pescado tacos could have been better. The mahi was beer battered but was fried for a little too long, changing the flavor entirely.

The carnitas were tough to chew. This was the first time I have ever seen the pork cubed instead of pulled. The flavor was alright though. 

Overall, I would describe the experience as ""not bad,"" but considering the hype and the whole celebrity chef hoopla, I expected something more in the ballpark of ""pretty good.""

Let's start with the best pedicure of my life. An hour and a half of luxury. 

Seriously this was an incredible experience that included foot and leg massage, paraffin wax treatment on my feet, scrubs, buffing and so much more. It was an hour of comfort and enjoyment before colour was even applied to my toes because of all the love my feet were getting! And colour choices galore! Beautiful reds, pinks, neutrals and darks - a great selection of China Glaze polish. Obviously this was the most spectacular pedicure ever.

With all of that I couldn't believe there was more but I got to experience my first facial here as well. If you want your face to be smooth for days, you need to experience a relaxing and rejuvenating facial! It is such a treat!

I had been here once before for a couples massage and we booked another one for our anniversary later this month. The couples massages are in a shared room and we're going for 90 minutes in a few weeks!

The whole experience feels like you're in another world. The Mediterranean feel throughout makes for a getaway in Edmonton. You're treated to luxury bath robes (FYI they go to 2XL which is awesome!) and a comfortable waiting room with water, tea and snacks. It's a total escape.

They also have tanning - both stand up and lay down, plus all of the lotions that you would need. You can also of course have other spa services as they have lots of great packages, plus make up application and so much more.

Gavel is a cozy coffee shop featuring a loft ceiling, large windows overlooking the street and high and low top spaces for seating. One thing that stands out at Gavel is that they offer both a coffee/tea and cocktail menu along with an assortment of pastries and light lunch eats but they do not offer espresso (cappuccinos, lattes, etc.) I really enjoyed my Guatemalan coffee served adorably with gummy bears. I would probably be apt to visit more often if espresso was on the menu given my go-to drink preferences. I've already been twice in the last two weeks so who knows, maybe I'll change my mind on this.

It's easy to spend a lot longer here than you intended, just watching the boats come in and out of the marina. I don't have much to say about the food here (not sure if I have ever actually eaten here -- lush) and I usually end up at the downstairs bar, Duke's. 

Don't be fooled by the parking situation... it always looks like it's packed since there are cars lined up all over the street, but I find that's usually not the case. I think most of the spots in the parking lot are taken early by boaters using the marina, so Hula Bay customers end up parking along the street.

259,657859931a6d2c7052a65685,"Update: Returned with some other bridesmaids and was helped by Regina, who was beyond helpful and personable. She dealt with my demanding bridesmaids well, answered all our questions, filled us in on promotions, and even tried to help my bridesmaid get additional discounts on their dresses. My only complaint was that she was helping about 3-4 different customers, but from what I hear, that is normal for David's Bridal. 

Original: My maid of honor and I came in on a weekday evening to scope out the bridesmaid dresses. We made an appointment and showed up about 10-15 min early. We were ""signed in"" quickly and paired with a sales associate. There was one other customer in the store at the time. I told the consultant the color we were hoping for and requested to see the color swatches so I could decide on the exact shade. She disappeared for quite a while and left us to shop the dresses on our own. Now normally, I prefer to shop on my own without a pushy sales person, but in a specialty shop like David's, a little guidance would have been much appreciated. 

Eventually we found several dresses to try on. The sales associate awkwardly stood there for the entire duration of my MOH trying dresses on. I tried to make small talk, ask questions about swatches and materials, etc., but it appeared she wasn't interested in conversation, so I quit trying. My MOH found a dress she liked, but I wanted to discuss color options with my fiancé, so requested color swatches to take home (which run $1 each). 

My MOH and I browsed the accessories a bit before the sales associate returned without the swatches. She started us walking us towards the door when I again asked her for the swatches I wanted. She finally got them for me and checked me out. 

While the selection of bridesmaids dresses was good, neither of us were impressed with the service and felt ignored for 90% of our visit. We will use David's for bridesmaid dresses simply due to the selection since my bridesmaids will get to pick their own dress in the selected color, but I'd definitely not consider their service adequate.",unhelpful,0,1

Fast forward to a few weeks ago where we went to Fusion Wasabi for lunch and I must say it wasn't bad. The sushi was surprisingly pretty fresh. 

The place looked pretty modern and trendy. Photos of mirth and good times captured forever plastered to the wall as soon as you walk in is always a crowd pleaser. 

The location seems kind of out of the way, but the place was full of daily grinders on lunch break, so that was another good sign. 

It was also good to see the owners (or someone there) had a sense of humor because posted on a placard by the bar was an ad for a special ""SB 1070"" roll. Whoever came up with that clearly didn't understand the cultural complexity of such a thing as the ingredients didn't make sense, if they were trying to be funny with it. Someone with a dark, sardonic, sarcastic sense of humor (such as myself) would have made that thing with refried beans, jalapenos, and crusted with crushed tortilla chips. HAHA. 

My only complaint is that when we were seated and the server came, they seemed to have the stereotypical Asian ""hurry up and buy"" vibe going on. The lady spoke very fast, making it seem like they wanted to feed us, then kick us out. Well unbeknownst to her, I was ""on duty"" and where I work, I don't get to go to any real city often at all so I wasn't going to be pressured even if I were playing Russian roulette while reading the menu. 

We ordered and shortly after we all had complimentary miso soup, a standard thing for sushi restaurants but it was nice to see they are on that page as well. Not long after that, all our meals came out. Expeditiousness really is their goal. 

The items are a bit pricey but that isn't usually a complaint of mine, not because I'm a big shot but because I enjoyed my meal and I had a good time.

Sadly the Curtis response was not dissimilar in fashion, to what others are reporting

Curtis was not at all interested in their lack of service
Unable to hear any criticism and absolute in their unwillingness to learn
Though very interested in berating me

Cheryl Curtis just rambled on about numerous topics
ie; 
Number of incoming phone lines, business structure...
Really Cheryl? 
To your customer these details are of no relevance
Seemingly it was anything she could come up with to obfuscate my issues
It went so far as;
Cheryl weaving a tale that I was contacted, by her no less
I was never contacted, remember this is what started my epic adventure
I am told internally Curtis did contact themselves, well that's swell
Cheryl bested her own incompetence by:
Telling me I was lying about the conversation between her employee and myself. 
Oddly this is was a conversation Cheryl was not privy to
Though she did remain absolute in her knowledge of its contents
note Cheryl never asked this employee what transpired
The conversation was regarding the following days schedule and what would transpire.

Oy Vey, in all Curtis has gone done the drain

Not the end of the world, it's not like you can hook a computer up to a car and figure out what's wrong with it, can you? While we were getting this fixed, it was discovered that the brakes were pretty much metal on metal. At this point I got a little hot under the collar. During the alternator fiasco my wife called the lot and spoke to the salesman (Q??) and was told, in not so many words, ""tough luck, you bought it, you deal with it"", so I have no illusions whatsoever that these guys will sympathize with sending a teenager off the lot in a car that isn't safe, due to the brakes.

292,657855641a6d2c7052a63398,"Went in recently after a hot day and was pleasantly impressed with the fun and refreshing decor.
Faux greenery is lined on the ceiling making a fun and refreshing take from our typical southwestern theme places. 
Of course, the nice cool AC is also a big plus!

Hostess greeted us immediately and stated it would be a 5 min wait while she got us a clean table, it was nice to see they were still implementing a COVID - social distance rule.  So, safe establishment.
We had a moment to run to the bathroom to wash our hands and was impressed with the cleanliness, not super fond of the sink - seems like there is allot of splatter, but give them effort for trying.

Table seems to be the old Korean BBQ tables they just vamped up the top part, so the bottom makes it a bit uncomfortable to sit since you have little to no leg room. However, since I'm pretty short that didn't bother me too much.
Service was friendly and prompt. Refreshments including water was refilled diligently.

We decided to partake in a ""pickle theme Bloody Mary"" and it was pickly delicious!!!
I decided on the Chicken & Waffle ( nice brunch staple ) with the bubbly waffle. Yup, you heard me. Bubbly!!
Makes for a fun new texture in the common waffle game, however they do offer Belgian Waffle for those that like the good classic comfort!
The chicken was a bit spicy which I absolutely dig!! And was nicely sliced, so easy to dine and enjoy.

The waffle itself was okay, not amazing, but good enough.
My husband enjoyed his breakfast sandwich and was too busy inhaling it to have much of a conversation -so, needless to say he quite enjoyed it!

The few cons that make this review a 4 star...
-Food is a bit salty. Like, everything is salty.... entree, drink, and sides. Makes you constantly chugging down some water while you eat. I would recommend to try and order something fruity and fresh to help balance everything out, but that was my main complaint. It's not that the meal was inedible, just more salty than average.
-Price was above average . 2 adults came out to roughly, $40 for 2 entrees & 1 alcoholic beverage.
I understand that seems to be the ongoing trend, recently in Tucson, but that's why most business usually fails... once the hype is gone, people tend to avoid the steeper price gauge.
-Location is also less than favorable, but giving them the leeway since they are connected to a large parking area in Sprouts shopping center. 
- Bank statement shows 7ounce Steakhouse. Which, I get it's from the previous establishment, but they should really fix that technical error so people don't get confused - especially if your new in town.

I would recommend this place to family and friends, but with the restrictions that I mentioned above. I did see that they had a separate room to ""reserve private parties "" which, I'm a big fan of.",helpful,1,0

We started with a sample of alligator sausage which was pretty tasty. Then we had a simple biscuit which I would have liked more of. Then the shrimp with corn on the cob and sausage was brought out and literally dumped on the table. It was piping hot and well cooked. The corn was a little over cooked but there was plenty of shrimp to make up for it.  I was surprised there were no potatoes in it. We had a nice pumpkin king cake for dessert. The entertainment was a singer with a ""big voice"" who played during dinner.

I came in and was greeted by my friend who took me towards the back and we sat down at the hibachi grill. 

The appetizers were pre-chosen and included both a ginger dressing salad and miso soup. The ginger salad came out first and it was fairly average. There were not any vegetables that stood out although the lettuce and cucumbers were fresh tasting. I also wish the ginger dressing was a bit lighter as it tasted very heavy. However, I was a fan of the miso soup. It was served very hot and the tofu added some nice flavor to the broth. 

After that, our hibachi chef came over. He started off by drawing a smiley face out of oil and then created a giant flame that bursted out of the hibachi grill. That was very cool! It was followed by heating up some rice and fresh vegetables on both hibachi grille. While those began to cook, he did some tricks by attempting to toss eggs into people's mouths. Eventually, the chef cooked up a variety of items on the hibachi grill including chicken, steak and fish. I decided to go with the chicken. 

My chicken was topped off with some soy sauce along with some rice and fresh vegetables. The chicken was tender, but didn't have too much flavor. Luckily, the soy sauce added some more flavor in that regard, but the chicken still lacked flavor. I was very much a fan of the rice, which was lightly grilled and had some fresh eggs mixed in. I loved the fresh vegetables as they were perfectly grilled!

The staff was the nicest staff I've ever met at a dental office.  They were very understanding of my adult terror of the dentist.  Everything was smooth and efficient.

I saw Dr. Todd Canetella for all of 5 minutes.  He introduced himself to me then came back and checked my mouth.    I thought it was brief but he let me know that he was approachable.  He was also very professional.

The only bad part of this office is the tricky parking situation.  They share a building with Ochsner and the parking is confusing.  I probably parked in the wrong parking area, but I didn't get ticketed or towed so all is well.

It is pleasant to sit outdoors because it's under the tree. One thing they definitely improve one's is to clean the outdoor furniture more often.

The three tacos including Carne Asada, pastol, and grilled shrimp. These tacos are pleasant to have. They are in good flavor. The quesadilla has a lot of cheese.

As far as I am aware, they are one of the only healthcare facilities in Saint Louis that explicitly champions the unique health-related needs of the queer community. They are passionate about providing care for folks in the LGBTQIA spectrum and are continually growing to better meet their needs.

I started seeing Dr. Hayden here regularly since this past October. In my experience, I have loved that they seem to value holistic health. When you first start off as a patient here, you are answer questions about multiple dimensions of your health, not just physical. I love that and think it's important. They also take steps to be sensitive towards people's preferred pronouns. 

What's more, they have a Walgreens inside of the facility that also has a handful of very kind and inclusive folks who always go above and beyond. 

Thanks for all you do, Southampton Healthcare!",helpful,1,0

It is a large red building, with some parking around the front and the side facing west, but has a parking lot in the rear. It is usually busy on weekends. You walk in the door, and there is a walkway on two side to the door to get to the hostess stand, which is through the double doors on the north side of the restaurant. 

I came initially for the debris fries. Crispy fries with roast beef gravy and bits of roast beef that you can have with or without cheese. It is really good. Their roast beef po-boy is really good as well. I have had their cookies and cream pie which was amazing and filling. Their potato salad is also quite good. They do have free refills on sodas, and I like how there is a roll of paper towels on the table so you don't have to keep asking for napkins. 

The restaurant is neat and clean, but the tables are a bit too close together in my opinion. The restrooms have always been neat, clean and well stocked whenever I have visited.

The hotel has a nostalgic look that has always appealed to me but not in the way that invited me in.

Last week I made a trip to Fort Lauderdale for a business meeting and planned to be in and out the same day.  By the end of the meeting it was clear I was not going to make the last flight out to Tampa. 

 Fortunately (quick shout out to Southwest Air, they make it easy to switch reservations) the River Side Hotel was within walking distance of the meeting.  And not only was I hot and tired, but very hungry as well; so this seemed like the perfect time to check this place out.  

The first impression as I entered was old world with clean adobe style tiled floors that definitely resonated with me.   The check in was painless and fast and the conversation was unexpectedly easy.   I have to admit was thirsty and as I turned to look around I'm pretty sure ""Preston's Wine and Martini Bar"" actually called my name!!  A few Fred Astaire steps later (not) I was met by some friendly patrons and a bartender ""Ryan"" who was on par with my overall experience.

MARGARITA and make it a double was what I should have said, but something told me chill and check out the wine menu.  At the moment I don't recall the name other than a cabernet.   As a total wine snob, room temp vino does nothing for me ... my only somewhat disappointing moment.  

Dinner was light turkey club on a smoky/nutty grain bread that was plenty for two and yummy. Breakfast was a feast - farmer's egg white omelet with mushrooms, asparagus, provolone, and a side of red bliss sautéed with onions and peppers.  Aaaand, Belgian vanilla waffles with fruit - AWESOME!

 Every time I come here looking for a specific item, they never have it. Yet, when I do come here looking for the special item, that they do not have, I never walk out empty handed. I usually walk out with one, if not two shopping bags full of things that I didn't even know I needed or wanted. This store has almost everything you'd want or need to make your house or apartment, your ""Home"". 

Think of it as a very mini BB&B. It has many of the same items, just not the variety or selection to choose from. You also have to be a smart shopper and look at the off brands they have to make sure it it a quality item for the price. I primarily stay with name brands that I am familiar with, unless it just a decorative item. 

HomeGoods is also a great place for spoiling the dog of the house. They have great pet beds, dishes and other items that will have your favorite K-9 thinking they are King or Queen of house. 

Like its' sister store, TJ Maxx, you have to shop often, as the inventory changes quickly. See it today, don't think about, it may be gone tomorrow.

I read complaints about wait time.  I can understand that concern, but it is because they are busy and the cuisine takes more time than standard fare to do properly.  Here is what you can do to have an enjoyable experience despite longer than average waits for entrees:  

Order 2 appetizers, the price is really reasonable and they will get those out to you fairly quickly.  I recommend Goma ae, the gyoza, and the shumai.

Have a miso soup, also very quick and cheaper than a soda.  

Have a sm salad with ginger dressing.  
Quick and affordable.

I hate to say this but after taking in everything they had to offer I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting so much more (unique flavored goodies).

351,657855651a6d2c7052a63f71,"Let's be honest. There are certain restaurants that elicit an automatic response - Applebee's is one of them. 

If there's a comparison, one could almost say that Applebee's is the Nickelback of the restaurant world. 

For the record, I unapologetically like Nickelback. 

So, yeah, there's that. 

I visited the Castleton Applebee's last evening after one errand turned into several and I ended up finding myself on a different side of town from where I'd originally planned to have dinner. 

The parking lot was relatively empty. I wouldn't say the restaurant was empty, but it sure wasn't full. 

Applebee's serves up fairly straightforward American fare with a broad menu that aims to please everyone but mostly has come to be identified as rather generic. 

It's the restaurant we like to beat up on, but we keep going back anyway. 

Truthfully, I've always had an appreciation for the place and I have many fond memories of my young adult years and dinners with friends at various locations with a fondness for the now closed Broad Ripple spot. 

I'd been to this spot before, but had never reviewed it and decided I could take this opportunity to do so. The pandemic is still in full force and Indy's mask mandate is still in place. Applebee's has ample signage that they're observing that mandate and practicing distancing by limiting seating. They also clean even their payment portals after each use. They also have laminated menus they disinfect. This location does not have outdoor seating. 

I've also been dipping back into the beer world and thought they had a broader beer menu than ended up being the case. 

Applebee's has several accessible parking spots and an appropriate curb cut. They also offer curbside pick-up - they offered this prior to the pandemic. 

The lobby area does not allow seating currently. However, I was alone and the hostess seated me at a booth (I'll admit this surprised me as they usually claim it blocks the aisle). I was a bit concerned initially as the hostess was clearly not wearing her mask appropriately - it was on, but not over the nose and actually barely over the mouth. It was a little bizarre considering you're slammed with signage at the door - then the first employee clearly hasn't read the signage. 

However, everything got better when my server, Rachel, showed up. She was instantly friendly and helpful and, yes, appropriately wearing a mask and she knew how to effectively speak while wearing it. 

She noticed and complimented my hair (which I'd recently dyed). It was that personable approach that turned my meal into something special. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries (wow, I hadn't done that in awhile!). I ordered my usual unsweetened iced tea after concluding nothing on the beer menu struck my fancy. 

The food was solid - it was delivered as ordered and good. It's not the best burger I've had, but it's far from the worst. I enjoyed it and would easily order it again. The fries were solid, as usual. 

I received an iced tea refill without asking. 

Rachel was attentive without being invasive. I took some time to do some reading and there was never a sense I needed to move on. There was definitely more than 6' between myself and any other customer. 

Applebee's is friendly and familiar. They have off days, sure, but for the most part they are pretty straightforward and generic. There are times, such as this one, when it goes better than usual and that usually falls on the server - you get a good one? Everything is great. You don't? Typically the experience suffers. Rachel was awesome and I enjoyed this visit and my trip down memory lane with Applebee's.",helpful,1,0

Since I am always on the hunt to find great Italian food (as it is my favorite kind of food to eat), I was very excited when my mom told me that we would be trying Modo Mio on Girard Ave for a family dinner.
Our waiter suggested doing the ""La Turista Menu,"" which is a four-course meal composed of an appetizer, pasta, entrée, and dessert. And for the price of just $33, none of us could resist! The best part was that it was not a pri fix or limited menu. You got to order off of the regular menu and select one item of your choosing from each category. But before we even had the opportunity to order, food was already being brought to the table. We received a plate of complementary Bruschetta Toasted topped with Grilled Eggplant and Cinnamon as well as Fresh Grilled Ciabatta Bread with Homemade Ricotta Cheese and Olive Oil infused with Porcini Mushrooms. My mom always says that you can judge a restaurant by the quality of its bread, and you better believe that we all got pretty excited for our entrees after trying this stuff. It was amazing! The ricotta was as creamy and smooth as butter and the olive oil had a tremendous earthy flavor from the mushrooms. The bread was also fantastic with a nice crispy crust and a soft warm center. 
Now that our appetites were going, we got to ordering our courses. For my appetizer I had the Creamy Potatoes with Lump Crab and Sweet Roasted Red Peppers. I was unsure as to how it was going to be served, and I was pleasantly surprised when it came out on top of more of that delicious bread!! It was definitely a rich appetizer, but it was too good to leave any behind. The crabmeat was abundant and not overshadowed by the potatoes. The roasted red peppers were perfectly placed atop the whole dish, and they added a great sweetness to every bite. I also tried the Mussels in Spicy Red Sauce, which were so tender and the best that I have ever had out! The sauce was great with salty capers and just the right amount of red pepper flakes for heat. My sister ordered the Egg Dipped and Fried Mozzarella Grill Cheese Sandwich with Lemon Caper Sauce, which I thought would be the grand-daddy of all grill cheeses, but I was disappointed by the strength of the lemon sauce. I thought it was too pungent and overwhelmed what could have been a really great dish. My other sister, Hannah, ordered the Calamari Stewed in Red Sauce with Capers and Olives. I thought it was good, but still prefer crispy fried calamari (call me unrefined...but at the end of the day they taste better to me!). I also had a bite of my dad's Seared Scallop atop Fried Chickpea Pancake. The chickpea pancake was fabulous and so was the scallop, but the portion was rather small for my liking.
My favorite course of the meal was the pasta! The next time I go to Modo Mio, I am going to ask to order two pasta dishes instead of an entrée. I ordered the Buccatini Amatriciana, which is a thick homemade spaghetti with pancetta in a spicy red sauce. The pasta was actual perfection, from texture to cook time, and the sauce was very nice. It was rich (and a bit oily) because of the pancetta, but worth every calorie! The Gnocchi with Porcini Mushrooms, Peas, and Pancetta in Gorgonzola Sauce was also rich, but undoubtedly the best gnocchi I have ever had the privilege of tasting. They were soft delicate pillows of potato and pasta that melted in your mouth. I was also pleasantly surprised by the gorgonzola cream sauce, which in some miraculous way tasted light! My other favorite pasta dish was the Carmelli Pasta Purses filled with Taleggio Cheese in a truffle-rosemary butter sauce. This dish was probably the richest of all the pasta dishes, but also really, really, good. Taleggio cheese is very strong (sometimes called the ""stinky cheese"") but when it is melted and gooey, it is delicious. My least favorite pasta was the Lasagna topped with a Fried Egg. I thought it was too rich to even taste good. The plate was covered in oil and the fried egg was just too much. I only had one bite and found that I couldn't get the greasy feeling out of my mouth.
For my entrée I ordered Skirt Steak with Green Olives and Fried Chickpeas. Although it was cooked perfectly, and tender and juicy, I thought it was way too heavy after all the food that I had previously eaten. I enjoyed the finely chopped green olives atop the steak, but the fried chickpeas, which were done in little flattened strips were far too oily. I would definitely recommend ordering a fish as an entrée, because it is on the relatively lighter side. My dad ordered the winning entrée, which was Grilled Swordfish with balsamic caramelized onion, golden raisins, pine nuts radicchio, smoked mozzarella, and rosemary pangrattugiato. This flavor packed entrée, just seems to melt in your mouth. It was by far my favorite entrée.",helpful,1,0

Then a couple of years later our general wanted to use DJ and we reluctantly agreed. Well, big surprise, we failed the HERS test. He sent a crew to repair their shoddy work and we had a second test that passed inspection. When we got the bill from DJ, upon advice from our general, we paid the full amount minus $550 for the second HERS test. Seems fair, right? I mean should we pay for 10 tests if his work fails inspection? So, we sent the payment with an explanation and asked that he call us. We called numerous times. No response. Instead, we get a bill and a threat to take us to small claims court?! Say what? No return phone call, no negotiating? After $40,000 worth of work that we paid for? We call again: Nothing, but a new bill, plus a late charge and a threat to charge us $75 for the small claims fee. Interesting business model: shoddy work, overcharge your customers, don't respond to them and then threaten to sue. Take my advice and avoid Rick's Heating and Air Conditioning.

The front desk agent Devin immediately greeted me and checked if my room was ready since I arrived there pretty early (noon). He kindly told me that my room wasn't ready and suggested to leave my bags while I walk around the neighborhood. The bell person offered to put my bags in my assigned room and Devin took my cell number so he can alert me when ready. An hour later and sure enough...I was promptly informed and my baggage were already stored in the room. Their hospitality made such a good 1st impression!

1) Hotel is located on Royal St. 1 block away from Bourbon. Excellent location!
2) Charming mid courtyard pathway with brick layered facade.
3) Room #17 was on the small side but spacious enough for 2 and located on the very top floor. This converted building does not have elevator so it might be tough for some to climb 4 flights of stairs to the room. 
4) Modern and simple furnishings. Clean white walls.
5) Bed was very comfortable and linens were laundry fresh.
6) Modern marble bathroom and nice Delta mixed w/ Kohler fixtures. My room didn't come with a tub.
7) LCD TV, Ipod dock, iron / board, ceiling fan, quiet A/C, ceiling fan.
8) Free WiFi and fast connection speed considering I was on the top floor

Check out was a breeze as well. Flight wasn't until 6pm so stored bags and again, Devin graciously offered to schedule a cab for around 3:30pm. Came back at 3:15 and arrangements were fulfilled as promised. Very impressed :)

Although my room had no coffee maker nor fridge, but really had no use for either. There's a local coffee bar across the street and numerous restaurants just steps away from the hotel.

I used to go to another salon in Clearwater, but after having them attempt over and over to get my hair a pretty blonde balayage without much luck (my hair just kept getting blonder and blonder, not to mention more unhealthy, etc.), I was desperate to find someone who actually understood my vision and had the skillset to do a balayage and/or a color melt. The final straw came when I wanted to try going dark again (back to my natural brown color) and I ended up with red halo hair. That was when I decided I was never going back, even though my stylist there did try to get the redness out one time for free. Of course I went to an Aveda salon as a quick fix to have them just get my hair dark period, but that was yet another HUGE mistake. Half of my hair was reddish brown and half of it almost black. Yikes!

So I took to the internet and searched locally, determined to make my first good hair decision in a long, long time. I added my favorite stylists to my Instagram and followed their hair techniques and before/afters very closely before committing to a new person, because let's face it: you can't and won't (nor should you!) trust just anyone with your hair.

I finally booked my first appointment with Tabby at Mikel's and OMG she's the BEST! She was very honest from the get go that my hair needed some serious TLC (at this point my hair still had some weird red leftovers in it and some very stubborn dark color...sigh) and that the picture I brought in was a good reference, but that we couldn't get there in that visit. I appreciated that she didnt just try to please me and examined my hair prior to making any decisions on the services. I was very happy when I left that day and booked my next appointment. I also accepted some of her product recommendations, because she didn't try to push them on me like most salons do. I even got a new client freebie!

I have missed the blonde and just had my second visit with Tabby to slowly progress back towards a lighter color. Again she was very honest with me and showed me how my ends were literally still breaking off due to the bleach blonde I had for such a long time. I ended up.agreeing to just cut that all off. It wasn't easy to hear that it's just not good for my hair to be THAT blonde, but a more natural look just has never seemed obtainable to me. I told Tabby that I agree with her recommendations and trust her 100% to take things slow and she did such a great color melt!! Even she was surprised how light we were able to go and my hair still feels silky smooth! I swear, she's the hair master of the universe!! Again, bought some product refills, because they work so well! 

I will be frank, the services I receive are not cheap. But like every reasonable adult I can say that you get what you pay for. This place and especially Tabby is worth every penny! Plus, the visits are fewer, so at the end of the day it's almost a break even to what Inused to pay...only my hair and I are much happier!!! The salon itself is beautiful, fun and friendly! They have a little spa room when you get your hair rinsed, which is calming and a big bonus. I would recommend the salon and Tabby to anyone who wants their hair done the right way!",helpful,1,0

397,657855641a6d2c7052a63362,"One of the nicest apartments in town - which also makes it one of the most expensive.  Expect to be paying at least $1,000 for a single bedroom.  The rooms could be larger, but the fixtures, flooring, appliances, and countertops are really nice for an apartment.  Almost every unit comes with a single-car garage, and there is a very adequate space set aside for a workbench or storage.  The parking is not assigned so if you have guests over, they do not have to stress about where they're allowed to park.  Having gated entrances is nice for peace of mind at night, however it's very common to see non-residents just drive in through the exit when someone leaves.  Also - a decent community gas grill at the clubhouse - which unfortunately uses propane cylinders which are almost always near empty.  The upper floor balconies have a pretty steep downward slope which is pretty annoying.  I'm going to have to retrofit furniture just to be level.

Location, Location, Location! Right in between Wal-Mart and WinCo, next door to Ben's Liquor, and super close to the freeway, it doesn't get better than this.  Also, south Reno beats any other part of town.

Very friendly and responsive staff & maintenance.  Rick gave me a hand the other day getting one of the charcoal grills going.  There is a dry-cleaning company that contracts with The Alexander that I use often - the price is good, and it's convenient that I only have to walk to the clubhouse to drop off or pick up.  The grounds are very well-kept, and the shrubbery looks very nice!!

Heated outdoor pool and Hot Tub Open All Year Long.  Pool area used to be open 24/7, but that didn't last long with the surrounding neighbors complaining about the noise late at night - which is understandable because at one point, the pool became the Reno hot-spot for everyone around town, regardless if they knew anyone who lived here or not..  During the day in summer - especially on weekends, avoid the pool at all costs - it's like a kiddy day-care center where the 600 residents send their kids.  At night, the Hot-Tub turns into a bro convention.  If you just want to relax, you have to go super early in the mornings, or any time during winter.

It seems that they're starting to screen and weed out some of the lower quality residents now that the units are starting to fill up.  Something for which I am grateful, although there are still definitely bad neighbors to be found.  

I've been here for over 2 years now and I am pretty happy with the place, although for the price of a 2-bedroom, I could just buy my own house and my own hot-tub.",helpful,1,0

My usual dermatologist does not have the equipment to use Photodynamic Therapy.  It can be used to treat precancerous skin cells as well as other uses.  I had a  consultation with Dr. Zook and he recommended the procedure.  

A special blue light activates a specific drug that is brushed on the area you want to treat and it kills off the precancerous cells.  They let the drug soak in for about 1 hour then start the procedure.  There is a little discomfort at first but you're only in the light for 16 minutes.  Considering the other options to get rid of precancerous cells, this was a breeze.

416,657855651a6d2c7052a63bef,"Awful. I came from Wells Fargo after all the rave reviews I was getting regarding local credit unions and because Wells Fargo customer service is so bad it's nonexistent. This credit union was an incredible disappointment. Not only do they take $1 for every DEBIT (not credit) transaction you have over 10 a month but their daily withdrawal limit is $205!!! This is a complete joke. I wish I would have read the terms much closer. All the reasons one goes to a credit union is completely forgotten or disregarded by this place. Oh and did I mention the fee to cash or deposit any foreign drafted checks is $25.00?! Even if the check is US currency (Wells Fargo is $5.00). 


Update: 
So despite my annoyance, I stuck with them for a few more months (more out of sheer laziness)- only for them to allow an unauthorized forced post transaction from Hertz to post on my account even after I had explained the situation to them, changed card numbers and put any such type of charges from Hertz on fraud alert. So I get a phone call from fraud alert the next day which I call back to expressly decline and I even call their customer service who reassures me that the charge has been declined then a month later I get $1200.00 taken out of my account using the OLD CARD number that the credit union itself had shredded a month prior. No alert no nothing. I found out when I tried to pay at Dunkin Donuts for a coffee. 

I finally convinced them to call Hertz with me on a three way call but not before they froze my savings (because of the $400 overdraft in my checking- which again was unauthorized) and my account so I couldn't even log in to see what was going on. Thankfully I got Hertz to acknowledge their mistake and was immediately credited all my money back but it still took the ""fraud investigator"" and ""collections employee"" a full day to coordinate with each other and unfreeze my account and that was after I was assured it would be unfrozen immediately. The fact that this credit union even let an unauthorized charge for that much money to post is downright frightening. I have since moved my account to a different, more reliable credit union. I will be contacting the National Credit Union Association regarding this.",helpful,1,0

We had a great experience at happy hour the night prior at Swizzle Stick Bar, the adjoining bar to Café Adelaide at the Loews Hotel. We figured Café Adelaide would be just as great if not better. The food was good and the ambiance was lovely and beautiful. It's a shame that the service was not up to par.

We made reservations in person earlier that evening for 7:30pm. My eight friends and I arrived on the dot and were promptly seated. Service was very slow. Time elapsed and we were only served cocktails and complimentary French bread for the first hour. We patiently waited almost one hour and fifteen minutes for our appetizers to arrive. And then we waited another 30 minutes for our entrees to arrive. And then another 20-25 minutes for our desserts to arrive.

Our bill was a bit in disarray with items added to our bill that were never ordered. We explained to the server that we thought some extra items had been added to the bill and we wanted them taken off and the bill split for our party of nine. The server was not able to resolve the situation and offered to get his manager. 

My girlfriend calmly told the manager that everyone felt there was some confusion with the extra charges since we had a couple of servers bringing us drinks throughout the evening. Additionally, she asked if the receipt could be divided individually. The manager was incredibly rude.  From the start, his tone was aggressive. He was unapologetic and condescending to my girlfriend for a couple of minutes and exclaimed that splitting the bill would require an extra 35 minutes on his part. His attitude and approach was astounding. Even if he felt we were in the wrong about the bill, there is a certain way to address the situation and discuss the matter professionally. He did not take the professional route. His refusal to attempt to remedy the situation was awful and his rudeness was disrespectful and completely inappropriate. 

Our entire dining experience was over three hours and this restaurant is not even a AAA Four or Five Diamond dining establishment.

Our server was polite and professional throughout the evening, but we were appalled by the behavior of the obstinate manager and his complete lack of respect for his patrons.

We tried the raved about dirty Mac and Cheese (Mac and cheese with pulled pork) and weren't disappointed. My husband had the grueben (grouper, Swiss cheese, slaw and thousand island dressing) with sweet potato waffle fries and I had a tenderloin and onion rings. They were both delish. I'm not a big fan of beer battered onion rings but if you like them these were really good. I was impressed with the single serving Proseco.

Prices are exorbitantly high--I remember easily paying approximately 10 dollars for a sundae that had very little ice cream and plenty of whip cream (yuck). By the time it was ready, the ice cream had already started melting towards the bottom. 

The only reason I can think of someone returning is that they do make pretty desserts. Their king cakes stand out from others--they have a metallic sheen, different from traditional ones. I think most are willing to pay a pretty penny for their sweets so they can share it on social media (you'll probably see lots of people ordering their macarons for this reason at 2-3 dollars a pop). For me, I'd rather walk to District Donuts down Magazine Street for my sweet fix.",helpful,1,0

447,657855651a6d2c7052a638a8,"My wife and I bought a Solitude Grand Design from Lazy Days RV back in April. We are going full living and wanted to go somewhere they had options to pick from. Our Salesman was named Tom and I will say he did a great job finding what we needed. But once we agreed to purchasing the 5th wheel it quickly turned into a nightmare. We made a deal that if LazyDays was able to find better financing for us that what we already obtained and a few other things we would go ahead with the purchase. The finance guy felt like he needed a few days to get the right finance package for us and because it was Saturday afternoon felt he needed until Monday to do so. (really wish at this point we would have just walked out the door and moved on). From here we were hounded on getting the finances we got finished and a check to them, our sales me bullied my wife and when I saw bullied I mean it...it was sad and so wrong but they said we couldn't get our deposit refunded if we backed out of the sale. We then went back and forth with two finance people who seemed to never communicate with each other including our salesman Tom. We lived over 4 hours away and Tom told us if we didn't have the finished finances by the end of the month we wouldn't get our deal anymore even though I told him there was no way we would drive back over. We got the check the second to  last day of the month and actually left a lunch with my parents who were visiting from Seattle to go and mail. In order to overnight it would have been $100 and we had just spend $80,000 on this trailer we felt it wasn't needed. The check got there on the first day of the Month and seriously got a check from our Salesmen Todd telling us it was his fault he lost his bonus!! Seriously buddy...we from the start told you we would not drive to Tampa nor would we have it there and would get it there asap. It was serious bullying and so wrongly treated but by this time we have invested our deposit into the 5th wheel and didn't want to lose it. 

Next was the delivery...another nightmare...they had the trailer for over a month before we could come stay the night and work out the kinks. Once we got there a slider was broken, siding hanging off in the bedroom, hand print on our blinds etc. We were suppose to have it delivered the next day but had to wait another 3 weeks because they had to fix the slide which they blamed on the manufacture. Well if you stay there one night you will notice they move these trailers around WITH THE SLIDES OUT AND LEVELERS DOWN!! You want to know why things get broken...its because they don't have respect the this purchase you just made. So after our 4 hour drive back up there to check out the trailer we still weren't getting our trailer. My wife actually drove back up before they delivered because we wanted to make sure...our kitchen slide...still doesn't slide out right. These people just seem like taking care of money and not their customer or their product. On not to mention....have not heard a word from Tom since his rude text about us losing his bonus!!! 

We love our trailer and Solitude is a great brand and I would recommend to anyone to maybe find the trailer they want here and then buy it somewhere else. Second recommendation if you get a guy named Tom as your salesmen...RUN!! (I've been nice not selling his full name) I will be calling Solitude this next week to talk with them about the conditions of the trailer because our oven doesn't even work but we don't even want to deal with Lazy Days again. There is so much more that I could tell you but just stay away and spend your money somewhere else. We live in Miami and seriously have no want to ever step foot at LazyDays again and to Tom who threaten my wife many times, I hope you get found out and lose your job!!",helpful,1,0
448,657855651a6d2c7052a635a4,"1911 Grill is close to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) and Hall of Fame Museum plus close enough you can walk or drive to the restaurant. Whether you're coming from the track, just looking for a good meal or want to hang out with friends then stop in. The newly built, family owned restaurant has been opened for over a year now. Many changes have occurred and we feel made the dining experience better plus the addition of the game room is yet another reason we continue to come back.  My family of 6 was in town two weeks ago and of all the restaurants on Main Street their still talking about how much fun they had at 1911 Grill. Good food, cold beers, a few shots, good music, darts, pool tables, games and shuffleboard kept everyone happy for hours. 

If Main Street parking is full you'll find additional parking off Ford Street behind SIK and the 1911 Grill.  For bikers, you'll find bicycle parking in front of or close by most businesses on Main Street. 1911 was built a little over a year ago by Sarah Fisher and her husband, Andy O'Gara, and named after the legendary IMS. The restaurant has two levels of family friendly dining and a bar on both floors.  Unfortunately there isn't an elevator but you can still dine downstairs plus view the SIK tracks from the large windows. The décor is a racing motif throughout with memorabilia from the Indianapolis 500 and personal collections of the family. The restaurant isn't the typical loud Pub and you can actually have a normal speaking level conversation.  There is a covered patio on each floor equipped with fireplaces, heaters for cooler weather, large flat screen TVs and sound system. 

If you haven't been to 1911 in a while then you should. Menu items have been added and removed several times. Requests and reviews have been heard by the owners with changes occurring around these reasons. Both the food and service has improved greatly from the first, even 5th, visit. The servers and managers follow through and provide a nice dining experience. 

We were thrilled with the addition of several appetizers and new menu items over this past year. The grilled chicken sandwich and 8 oz. grilled, breaded or Cajun tenderloin along with desserts made us smile. My favorite here is the Red Wine & Mushroom Burger but they are kind enough to substitute grilled chicken for the burger. The Red Wine and Mushroom Chicken sandwich is DELICIOUS.  My way is grilled chicken seasoned with Cajun seasoning then topped with grilled onions, red wine mushrooms and Swiss cheese on a soft brioche bun.  The sandwich is scrumptious and totally messy.  Be sure to request extra napkins when you order.  The Winner Winner Chicken dinner is basically the same without the bun and my special add-owns.

The hand breaded Fish sandwich has a thick, well-seasoned breading with light, tender cod inside and topped off with lettuce, tomato and lettuce on a brioche bun.  The Fish wasn't greasy and a nice size portion.  Most sandwiches are served with French Fries or Chips.

The Shrimp Dip was a huge hit with my family as well as the Buffalo Chicken Dip, Fried Calamari, Crab Stuffed Mushrooms, Boneless Hot Wings, Jumbo Tenderloin and Spicy Chicken Sandwich. If you love BLT's and BACON then definitely try theirs. It has 10 slices of bacon and a hand full of goodness. I didn't try the thin crust Pizza but I was told it was tasty.  The Backfire Shrimp was good but we expected hot or at least spicy with the word fire in the title. It wasn't hot and just a tad heavy on the mayo.  Now, IMHO, the Red Pepper Pasta is still lacking flavor and seasoning but I can always add my own spices at the table or home. The Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich has tender pulled pork but mediocre BBQ sauce. It's okay but it wouldn't bring us back if that was the first time and all we'd had. 

This is a great place to schedule an event.  1911 is a good-looking restaurant with the impressive Speedway Indoor Karting (SIK) attached.  Upstairs has changed if you haven't been here in a while and easy to entertain a group of folks. They have moved all the games into what use to be the large dining area.  The addition of the pool tables makes for a cool game room with tall top tables and you can dine upstairs or downstairs. Both floors have large windows where you can watch the go-carts at SIK. 1911 has two private banquet rooms upstairs which holds 250 and 350 if it hasn't changed. Check out their website or call to find out more about private parties at 1911 or SIK.",helpful,1,0

First of all I was shocked at all the bad reviews for this place which are all over the web.   They have a pretty large menu - good food for a reasonable price.  Staff was nice.  We didn't have to wait for anything.  The place was very clean.  Newly refinished hardwood, no stains on the carpet like some reviews mentioned.

I went  there for lunch and the only complaint I had was that the Sprite I ordered tasted weird (very bitter). I did notice a plate or two going back to the kitchen from one table.  But that table looked like a bunch bitchy looking girls so I didn't pay it much mind. 

I ordered the Calamari salad and it was amazing!  The other two people liked their meal too.  We liked it so much we are going to try it for a holiday luncheon.

It succeeds at it's goal - to be a 4-star dining experience with admittedly student staff.

456,657855651a6d2c7052a63683,"Wow! NOLA truly knows how to throw a party!

We came from Tucson AZ to find a good time in the French Quarter and we found it. The Festival was incredible - I've never tasted food so good, I've never seen so many wonderful (and totally free) bands play. The weather was perfect beyond perfect and the only regret I have is that our trip didn't last longer. 

First thing I'd recommend for out of towners who are visiting for the festival - don't skimp on the hotel, because there are some shiesty areas in this town. Also, book in advance. You want to be staying right near the action. 

There is a long stretch where you can walk the length of the festival - I liked the way it was set up because you could easily navigate the area and give directions to people who would ask you - where the hell did you find those monster crawfish? Well, we found them right down there about a half a mile, at a tent called Rouses Crawfish Boil. 

The white tents are everywhere - there seems to be hundreds of them - and each one is a different restaurant, serving up little (sometimes not so little) samples of their best dishes. So instead of visiting NOLA and having a panic as to which restaurants to try, you can try them all - Galatoire's, Antoine's, Broussard's, The Court of Two Sisters... and a million others. We ate poboys with every type of filling - shrimp, oysters, lobster, CATFISH!!! We ate pralines and crepes, turtle soup and gumbo, and  probably a couple too many of the famous rum-filled Hurricanes. Everything was under 9-10 bucks. Amazing. Everywhere we walked, a different jazz band was serenading us. 

I would recommend any foodie or jazz lover to visit NOLA for this festival - it was an unforgettable experience.",helpful,1,0

My wife ordered the Midas Cup which was their most publicized drink and she said it did not disappoint.  She also tried a Bloody Mary but didn't enjoy that as much.

With that said there's a problem when you wait for 1.5 hours for your food and the restaurant isn't even busy. We weren't angry, just wanted to bring it to someone's attention. We asked to speak to a manager which we were told was cooking in the back. I never, throughout our entire visit saw a manager in the diningroom. My guess is there wasn't one on duty. The bartender was nice enough to comp a round of drinks for us ""draft beer and whiskey and coke"" and we left dissatisfied.

The atmosphere reminds me of cramped little diner. There is a cute shaded patio outside, too bad it's Tucson and the heat makes you run for the much less aesthetically pleasing indoors with the A/C.

Major kudos for being so vegetarian-friendly! Love. 
Eclectic in the sense that the menu offers items inspired by Mexican cuisine and some by traditional and modern American cuisine. 

Recommendations:  
(lunch/dinner)
-Mexican Tortilla Soup (chicken based broth, no meat chunks in the soup, yay). A light yet filling option.
-Hacienda Salad with Cilantro Chicken or the Francisco's Enchilada Salad (de Michoacán). Both varieties offering a fresh twist on a traditional ""taco salad"" 
-Vegetarian Torta with grilled eggplant, red bell pepper, artichoke heart, onion, tomato, melt- ed havarti and Parmesan cheese on a wheat roll.
-Carne Asada Tacos. Yummy.
-Open-faced Chicken or Carne Seca Enchiladas. A 'heavy' meal option but so worth it! Great flavors and taste.
(brunch)
-whole wheat pancakes with any of the offered toppings are a never wrong choice.",helpful,1,0

483,657855651a6d2c7052a6400b,"I'm pretty sure they flagged my first review because they were embarrassed by it, but I think it's worth hearing my story. I went to aveda institute expecting to get a trim and walked out with 6 inches less hair. The service from the student who cut my hair was despicable; she told me to ""just leave"" when I said I was unhappy with my hair. She washed my hair with cold water, turned me away from the mirror the entire time, and was mumbling constantly about how she had to ""leave for work"". I don't believe all of the students/stylists act the way but it speaks a lot for the institute's quality control when they do not watch this sort of behavior. I did not see a ""teacher"" around, besides the initial consult where I told her I wanted an inch and a half off (obviously, the student wasn't paying attention as she cut off 5-6 inches).

I luckily was refunded for the service and was promised to have my hair fixed. The owner of the school is very nice and i appreciate that she took the time to speak with me, However, when I called to come in I never received a response. I also saw that my first negative yelp post was deleted, presumably flagged by the institute. I would have taken it down had they not given up after refunding my my measly $12-- which does not even cover a third of what I'll have to pay to fix my uneven hairdo, nor the emotional stress that the experience has caused me.

We typically don't venture over to St. Pete too much, but decided to give The Library a shot based on all the good reviews. They do have a small parking lot, but there is paid street parking if it's full (which it was on a Saturday morning). I highly recommend making a reservation beforehand, they make it very easy through OpenTable and you can choose inside or outside seating. We chose to sit outside on the patio which was lovely, but definitely sit inside if you want more of the library feel.

You can't start brunch without a Mimosa! I liked that they had several different juice options to go with the champagne. They do not do bottomless mimosas if that's something you're looking for. We all shared the Cinnamon Bun as the reviews were amazing, and Yelp did not let me down. It is fairly large so I recommend getting one for the table to share. For entrees, I got the Pork Belly Benedict which was delicious. Others at the table got the Breakfast Burrito with Truffle Fries and the Breakfast Flatbread. They both said they were very good.

Service was pretty good, though we were without water or refills for most of the meal. Just a personal pet peeve of mine.

489,657855641a6d2c7052a633ca,"I really like this restaurant. Service is attentive, food comes out quick and piping hot, and the lunch prices are fantastic. My first visit, I had the chicken pad Thai. That's the go-to for me when I'm trying out a new Thai place. If that's good, I'll branch out. The portion size was HEAPING, and the flavors were spot on. 

The crab rangoon are a must order! They are the best I've had in Tampa; crunchy with the perfect amount of filling. I didn't realize they had curry inside of them until my first glorious bite. My husband and I wanted a bucket full of them. I nearly had to stab him with a knife to get my half of the plate.

I've also ordered takeout during the week, as it's near where I work. Parking is abysmal at lunch time, because all the neighboring businesses have reserved parking spaces. The lunch specials are more than reasonable, with many priced at $6.95. Note: soup is usually included with entrees, but they don't include it with takeout orders. That's kind of disappointing, because the price doesn't decrease when you don't get soup. 

You do get a little salad still for takeout, but while it looks fresh, it's a little sad mix of cukes and iceberg lettuce. They do put the dressing in a small container though, so it won't leak out. The to-go boxes are also lined with foil to prevent foods like curries from leaking out. I appreciated this touch immensely!

My takeout entree was the panang curry with no bell peppers. They really ruin food for me, so I was very pleased when my takeout box even had ""no bell peppers"" written on it. There's nothing worse than placing an order and being ignored, especially when you've gotta get back to work!

My husband absolutely loved the red curry he got here. I've never seen him clear a huge plate of it so fast.

Side note: the ambience in the left side of the restaurant is very cute with little canopies over the booths and fairy lights. Needless to say, I recommend you give this place a shot if you love Thai food.",helpful,1,0
490,657855651a6d2c7052a6435c,"I've been going here for a while and overall my experience has been decent. However, it's never a consistent experience. My last few instances have been rather frustrating. I've consistently had issues with billing. The first time, I just wanted glitter polish but instead the nail tech used a dip powder, which was fine but the price cost just as much as my gel refill and to my friends it ""wasn't worth the price"". Given that I was in a rush that day, I let that charge go. The next time I went, I had a good experience, no billing issues. My last and final time I went was about a week ago. The nail tech didn't  know the prices to anything this particular week (although she gave me a run down of prices the last time I visited her), so I knew I was in for another surprise bill. Yep! I was ""mistakenly"" charged an extra $15 for my service. In that moment, when the final price was communicated to me, I questioned it. The nail tech informed me it was because my nails grew (side bar- it was less then a half of inch in growth) and the nail salon charges for length. I couldn't believe that!! So I checked my bill later that day and found out I was overcharged in another service by $15. I immediately notified the salon (called, texted and emailed). I was informed the charge would be reversed by end of day and if not, to call and remind them. What?! So now, Im the secretary for the salon?! I have to call and remind the business to credit my count for the overcharge? I'm busy as well!! ‍

Fast forward one week later (present day), I still have not been refunded! Instead, they have asked me to send them my address so they can issue a check. What?! My service was not paid by check! Why do I now have to wait another week for a check that may never come?!  Give this comment a like if you think I deserve my refund in the same method I paid for my service or via another expedited method?! 

Now, if I had to rate this business based on quality nails rather than how business is conducted and customer issues are handled. I'd give them a 5. Unfortunately, I'm rating the overall business and in the world of competition, how you treat people will always prevail.

Not a soul where we chose to sit. Server brought water and menus. Front page of menu is 1/3 about oysters, asked about fresh, pricing etc., I ordered a Magnolia, beverages and fried green tomatoes. Server returned, for dinner order I ordered fresh oysters, side salad, red beans and rice. Others ordered the panned plate of shrimp and oysters. Another order was the Benevile chicken. 

Several minutes passed and the server returned , she said they were out of fresh oysters. Did I want to replace with fried, I declined. I was thinking at this point any oysters ordered would be three days ago or last month's.  Can you imagine a NOLA restaurant running out of oysters? So I said just add some andouille sausage to my beans and rice.  The Magnolia arrived, tasted good but a bit off. Did not realize until later that evening that the sparkling wine was substituted with club soda. By the way the drink was delivered by hand, not on a tray. No coaster or bar napkin. Was thankful there was a straw. Low end service. At this point I was beginning to feel like we were an annoyance not guests.

Then the food orders started to show up, on the plate three fried green tomatoes with sauce and u40 sized shrimp. Sauce was good but no way to get at it, no bread, like in the pictures, not even a cracker. Again not NOLA.  Tomatoes were ok. The entrees appeared after several minutes. Presentation was lacking. The Beneville chicken looked like something out of a frozen dinner box, the panned plate had three shrimp not much larger than those on fried green tomatoes. And two fried oysters, there were some wilted greens or spinach and four sugar coated grapes?? The beans and rice looked dry, and they were, mine had   andouille sausage bits, that were either blackened or burnt. They did not get eaten.  My side salad was warm and dry, with 3 whole cherry tomatoes. Back to the oysters, wife tasted one of the two fried on the plate, they were not edible, I also tasted, she was right.  No fresh oysters should have been a clue. Server apologized and brought out a cup of red beans and rice.

Then came the beignets, don't believe the pictures, what we got were not beignets, they were fried pastry dough at best, tough, thick and hard bottoms.  Needed a knife and fork to cut. Not airy and light. If you are going to copy at least be good at it. Powdered sugar was authentic. Would have been nice to have coffee, none suggested or offered.

-Bulla: They brought their best sangria ever + some delicious paella! The sangria earned my vote for best drink!

-California Tacos To Go: They had one of the longer lines but it moved pretty quickly. The offering here was a pretty fully loaded taco that was delicious!

-Carrabbas: The chicken marsala was honestly was one of the best tasting items at this event!

-Dough Nation: The combination of sugar cookie flavored cookie dough with a little vanilla ice cream was epic. My wife and I wished that they offered a serving size this small at the actual Dough Nation location because it was the perfect amount!

My bf's house is about a 15-20 minute drive away. At 5:13PM, my phone sends me a notification stating that my reservation was canceled. I am usually a mild mannered person and I don't freak out easily, so instead of freaking out, I called 215-GET-A-CAB to speak to someone and the girl on the other end said that she didn't know why my reservation was canceled, but she assured me that a cab would be at the house in 10-15 minutes.

I asked what is the point of offering reservations if you can't meet them. No one could give me an answer and they just kept saying that it was a Sunday. No one apologized, no one offered any solutions, and basically made it my issue to get myself to the bus stop (and I did miss my bus btw). I asked how come no one was calling me to tell me that no cabs were available since 5:15PM and I had to keep calling, especially since they had my number. I finally decided to give up on them and found a way to get to the bus stop, but on the way, the dispatcher calls me to ask me if I still needed a cab.

My order included a regular sized pork sandwich plus an added side of corn on the cob, a potato salad and banana pudding! It was a lot of food and in retrospect for my next visit,  I'd do one side and upgrade the sandwich to a jumbo instead! 

The actual menu appears to offer the option of making the sandwiches a ""plate""  which would include two sides for an additional $3 but the online menu was limited to baked beans, corn and potato salad. Not sure why other sides are not online as an option when it comes to the plate combos?

Overall I throughly enjoyed my pulled pork, the coleslaw and bbq sauce is a great combo although I did have to add more bbq to the sandwich as I could barely tell there was much on it.  The pork had great flavor though and I look forward to trying more items soon!",helpful,1,0

I have an older model Mac and Springboard always has the part I need in stock. I was actually a little shocked the first time I went there that they had the right battery for a (at that point) 5-year old computer readily available.

And the staff is great. There is never ever a need to look around for what you need since someone is always there to immediately greet you and ask what you need help with. Today I went for my adapter and they had the official Apple models on the floor, but without me even asking the sales associate went to the back to get a third party model to save some money. Very nice of him.

So why only three stars? It all comes down to the prices. See, not being able to turn my computer on makes it a bit less convenient to shop online, especially when you really don't have time to wait for shipping. While I'm all for local business, this is a case where online shopping would save a ton of green. My adapter today, after tax, cost $53. I can get similar models online, including ones I know are by good companies and will last for a few years, for about $20 less. That's a huge markup.

I wanted to like this place- so my fiancee and I gave this place three tries- but it struck out every time.  Our first visit occurred within the first week of Zen Den's opening, and, to give them credit, about an hour before close.  The barista looked exceptionally pissed that we had walked in, and treated us with a complete lack of care- basically threw our cappuccinos at us as quickly as possible.  

Our second visit occurred around 3 p.m. after about a month of their being open, and we were treated with a lot more warmth; however the barista must not have been trained because when we inquired about what white teas were available she acted as if she had never heard of it before and said about as much. Thankfully, a woman whom I presume to be the owner intervened and told us about the three different varieties of white tea.  Unfortunately, both versions we tried (which we allowed to brew for five minutes) ended up being completely tasteless, so much so that we threw it out.

Our final visit was about a month ago, around 6pm, and, similar to Robert L. our barista was more interested in their cell phone than actually doing their job. It took her a few minutes to realize we were there, and again was completely clueless as to what tea was in stock.  This time I opted for a green tea which was listed, but it was not is stock, so I decided on another, supposedly similar option, which ended up being stale.

The Zen Den should look  into hiring better baristas who actually care enough to learn their offerings and would like to treat their job seriously.",helpful,1,0

A group of us came here for a later lunch, and we started off with their famous Beer-Battered Kosher Dills - OMG, these are SO DELICIOUS!  They're quartered pickle spears, dipped in a beer batter, and then deep-fried - they had a slight crisp exterior with a nice little chew in the middle; the pickle itself was super hot, and the creamy horseradish buttermilk dip was such a great sauce to dip it in! YUM!

We also ordered: Pilsner-Brined Hot Wings (these wings were super plump and oh-so-juicy! The side of the blue cheese dip was really good, as it had chunky bleu cheese within); the Slow Roast Pork sandwich (with sharp provolone, baby spinach, and spread with a garlic mayo; this was okay; filled generously with chopped roasted pork, it had a heavier pork flavor to it; came with a side of fries that were a little cold and limpy); Grapefruit and Goat Cheese Salad (ruby reds, goat cheese, grapefruit vinaigrette, arugula, and vanilla olive oil croutons with some bits of deep-fried pork belly); and, McMemphis Chicken Sandwich (Korean fried chicken, gochujang, lettuce, pickles, and garlic mayo, all in a long roll; these were little chicken tenders tossed in a ginger-heavy gochujang sauce; the bread was sesame-seeded and slightly toasted; I wasn't a fan of this, as the chicken was a little overcooked and the gochujang sauce was just not good (it was sweet, rather than spicy/savory).

The space itself is not too big, as when you step in, there's a bar area; when you keep going, there is a small dining area.  One thing I wasn't a fan of was that the dining area didn't seem to be AC-ed well, and there were just way too many flies.

536,657855651a6d2c7052a642cc,"I came in with a group of 3 other black women on a busy night after Krewe Du Vieux. This was our first and last time ever coming. Understanding that it was probably a busy night, we were told that only sandwiches and fries were available. I'm also cognizant that being a busy night for one of the most popular Mardi Gras parades, employees were probably tired and dealing with drunk people all night (There were literally adults vomiting in the grass outside). However, that is not an excuse for the treatment we received. 

One of the members of my group has a food allergy (gluten). Considering only sandwiches were available, she asked what alternatives/substitutes for the bread were available. Chelsea, who works at the register, was completely rude in her responses to our questions. 

We were told that the only substitute was to have salad instead of bread. When informed of the allergy, we were told verbatim by Chelsea ""Well, you can get some salad"". Obviously with such a helpful statement, there was no way to be confused. 

We were told they were not serving their platters, which is essentially meat + salad. However, they were suggesting for us to substitute salad (for an additional charge of 2$) for bread to accommodate a food allergy. Obviously, being our first time here, we were confused at the difference, and just asked simple questions -- mainly, what is the difference between this sandwich-turned-salad-and-meat combo ....and the actual platters? And will it be the same proportions as the platter? Simple, pretty valid questions.

Chelsea, and her general manager Ben were absolutely condescending when we expressed our confusion. They were sniggering and laughing, obviously mocking us. They were continuously asked why we were confused, and as Ben walked by Chelsea, he also was laughing and mocking us, eventually stating ""it's not that confusing"" and something along the lines of ""then don't order anything"".

After being mocked by Chelsea and Ben while 2 other members ordered their food (who also experienced attitude), the member of our group with the food allergy got understandably upset. After this, Chelsea - told us to ""Go to Rally's"" - an insult that is clearly and blatantly coded based off our race and assumed socioeconomic status. I don't think any other customer would have been told to go to a fast food restaurant to accommodate a food allergy, so I'm curious to know why Chelsea and her management thought that was appropriate.

After being mocked and insulted, and understandingly upset, Ben threatened to call the police on us for confronting them about their horrendous customer service. Other patrons began to yell at us, and attempt to further degrade us. The only individual who even possessed common sense and agreed with the poor customer service, was a delivery driver.

After de-escalating, I worked to cancel the orders of my two other friends, which was met with an insincere attitude. I calmly explained to Ben and Chelsea that the way they both spoke to my friends and I was unacceptable, no matter the reaction: we weren't ""drunk"", we weren't ""stupid"", we were simply confused at the lack of explanation and accommodation of a food allergy, and further perplexed by the exasperation, condescending attitudes and fairly racist comment. 

Ben (the general manager, mind you) walked away, while Chelsea continued to defend her post with ""I don't get why she was confused"" stance, and rallied other employees and customers to agree. 

What I fail to understand is how this food establishment is (1) vegan-friendly and considerate of dietary restrictions, and (2) proudly boasts of their location in a racially and economically diverse neighborhood, and yet blatantly greets both customers of color and customers with food restrictions with condescending, inflammatory microaggressions from both employees and management. 

Frankly, I am angered by the employees of Kebab's portrayal of us as the ""Angry Black Women"" trope, who are somehow not deserving of even basic customer service or human decency in our interactions. Customers will ask questions (duh!) and get upset when you answer rudely, so why are you in the hospitality industry if you can't answer a few questions without rolling your eyes, scoffing and back-flipping into coded microaggressions? 

Also, to add insult to injury, I was appalled to find out the traditionally halal food that they serve includes pork instead of lamb. Only a calm two hours later, our friend who received her food and ate it, got food poisoning.

Overall, I would not recommend ever supporting this establishment. I hope the owners and management at Kebab will do their due diligence and teach their employees to understand the importance of customer service.",helpful,1,0

The dudes out front gave me a glance, like, ""What the F *** do you think your doing...?"" I pulled my Eagles hat lower over my brow as I got out of the car and gave them a wink. Sometimes being 6'4"" is enough for street corner respect or at least a pass. Or, maybe it was just the hat. They had less risky things to do on a Sunday night. 

Anyway, we found our way inside the restaurant and were immediately taken by the white linen, heavy flatware, and polished marble floors. Okay. This wasn't a local pizza joint. These folks were serious about creating an atmosphere of opulence in the middle of this urban jungle. For the most part, they succeeded. 

What was even more pronounced was the fine quality of the food coming from the kitchen. We ordered calamari, roast chicken and rice soup, chicken marsala, chicken francais, a side Caesar salad and house veggies - roasted potatoes and broccoli. One thing was better than the next. 

The squid was nicely deep fried with excellent dipper. They were all rings, without tentacles, which gave the impression they were received that way from the purveyor rather than being sliced in house. Liked them, but would have been better if handled completely by the chef. The soup was excellent - creamy, flavorful with lots of chicken and rice. The Caesar and veggies came with dinner. Both were more than adequate, but small in size and just a solid complement to the stars of the show. 

Tuscany knows from sauces. They did a masterful job on the marsala and francais reductions. The marsala had plenty of chunky fresh mushrooms in a dark marsala wine base. Very nice. The francais was heavy into lemon and white wine with light egg batter coating, in which the thin chicken fillets had been pan sautéed in extra virgin, amply caramelized and set afloat. One of the best things I have put in my mouth this year. Wowee! 

Service was very good. Friendly and casual. Plenty of time between courses, and many stops to inquire of our satisfaction. Dessert looked tempting, but enough was enough. Most surprising was the pricing; reminiscent of the turn of the century. 

Aside from the poor acoustics caused by all the hard surfaces, Tuscany Ristorante was a total win. We will definitely be back.",helpful,1,0

Several rounds ended up costing far less than I anticipated, a welcome respite in this world of fourteen dollar cocktails in which we live. 

The music was on point and just loud enough. The TVs were programmed to whatever games were taking place.

550,657855651a6d2c7052a641ef,"I feel like I should preface this review by saying that I used to go to The Silk Hat* almost every day for years. I was really upset when they closed down and weary about what would open up in this spot. To be honest, I never really intended on going to The Hat. However, I ended up there tonight for a friends birthday dinner. 

The interior is just as trendy as every other trendy place in Edmonton. I can't really even describe it because it didn't stand out to me. It was dark, with booths along one side and a long bar on the other side with stools. We had a reservation for about 10 people, so we were at a big table all the way at the back, right beside the door to the kitchen. The first (inexplicable) thing of the night that I noticed were the 11 TVs lining the walls. The restaurant seems to be trying to come across as pretty upscale, so the TVs showing sports seemed verrry out of place to me. 

We got there around 5pm and there were only a few other people, but as the night went on it got busier and busier. By the time we left at 8:30pm it was totally full. Young, trendy, good looking crowd. People definitely dressed up to dine here, see and be seen.

Our waitress was alright at first, but got progressively more bizarre as the night went on - coming at inappropriate times (like too soon after someone got the menu), not really checking on us during our meal, long delays in bringing drinks, talking really loudly. She lost her friendliness pretty quickly. One of our friends was trying to order a drink that the bartender was apparently unfamiliar with, and me and my hubs caught her giving him the dirtiest look - whoa! I don't want to attack the girl, but I just don't think she was doing a very good job. 

And now onto the food. We ordered a few appetizers to share at first - the bruschetta, wings and fresh baked brie (order three appetizers as a Hat Trick for $28.75). The bruschetta was great, the wings were pretty tasty, but I didn't like the sauce that came with the brie (strawberry and chocolate). I ordered the blue cheese burger with a house salad as my main meal and I have to say, I was disappointed. First of all, it was huge and I had to squish it between my palms to be able to eat it. Secondly, and worst in my opinion, the beef was way too dry. I would expect that from a bison or elk burger, but for straight up beef, it was just wrong. It was hard to eat and I didn't finish it. I don't think I'll ever be back here, but if I did I think the way to go would be to do the Hat Trick. I was disappointed that the menu consisted of solely burgers, hot dogs and sandwiches, as I wasn't really in the mood for any of that tonight. The apps were much better than the burgers. I had a bite of my husbands Canadian burger and it was also just alright. Not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination. 

The second and third inexplicable things I noticed about this place were that 
- It was really quite dim in there to begin with, and they dimmed the lights even further at about 6:30pm. It was beyond dim, and just plain dark.
-At pretty much exactly 7pm, the music switched from Franz Ferdinand/The Strokes mellow rock in the background to loud dance music. This place does not have a dance floor and is not a club by any means. I'm not sure why they felt this was necessary. Maybe at 10pm, but 7pm? I don't think so. 

Sadly, I file The Hat in the category of restaurants in Edmonton that are trying too hard and won't be back. All style, no substance.

* The Silk Hat was a diner that had been open since 1912 and probably hardly changed in that time. Juke boxes at every red booth, a tea leaf reader in the back, waitresses that looked like they were straight out of the 50s, hamburgers as big as your head, and Elvis and Sinatra look-a-likes at the long bar. Out of every place I have been to in the world, I will always remember it as my favourite place. RIP Silk Hat.",helpful,1,0

The ER was very good in the care of my mom, they treated her quickly and efficiently, getting her a bed and medication to ease the pain she was in.  

Through basic Xrays, they determined that she had a broken knee cap. This meant that she would need to be seen the next day and kept over night for observation.  Good. 

She was taken up to the 3rd floor where she was promptly taken care of by a fantastic team of nurses. Each and every one of them was competent, compassionate and kind every day.

I wasn't expecting much however I was pleasantly surprised. I arrived on a Saturday night about 7pm, and this place was packed. I was told there would be a short 15 minute wait so decided to stick around. Much better than the two hour wait at Tucanos Brazilian Grill. 

Once seated I looked over the menu and decided to start off with the Toasted Cannelloni as an appetizer, which was good however priced at $8.95 I felt that they were overpriced for only four. For my entrée I decided to try the Ravioli with Meatballs, it was good the sauce was a little sweet but I wasn't thrilled with the ravioli. The meatballs were large and had a great taste, they seemed homemade and very delicious.

The waitress was amazing she was on top of things and never let our glasses get below half full, kudos to her! The decor and atmosphere was a little dated, I think they tried to hard to try to make you feel like you are dining in a Tuscan village. The walls are painted with what looks like an window overlooking an Italian hillside, that is tacky in my opinion.

The interior is bright with plenty of natural light and plants. 

The menu offers an option to build a plate, order empanadas a la carte or a combo. The Bombo Combo is your choice of one empanada with one sauce, two sides and a medium iced tea for $8.35, not bad! 

I ordered a la carte: Aloo Matar Samosa is vegetarian. Stuffed with spiced potato and green peas. I chose the Mint Chutney as suggested. I also ordered a side of the Honduran Cabbage Salad- fresh chopped cabbage with tomato, onions , cilantro in a lemon dressing. This was the perfect combo! The flavors are so bright in each item. The mint chutney had a kick to it. Truly irresistible.

 Make sure to pick up an iced chai tea to pair with the food.  

Bombolé is perfect for a quick lunch. Or stop in for take out.  Once the temperatures cool down, pick up your lunch and enjoy outside in Jacome plaza just across the street.",helpful,1,0

Most of these boys are slim/smooth twink-y types, but a few boys are older and a little more ""rough trade"" looking if that's your thing. I'm going to hazard a guess and say that more than 3/4 of the dancers are some form of ""gay for pay,"" so don't mistake their attention for anything authentic. 

Make sure to get a bunch of singles from the cash-only bar and tip the boys well. They will treat you very special for a few minutes or come down off the bar and hang with you. Unfortunately, the claustrophobic nature of the bar precludes any ""private dance"" rooms, so a lot of the higher-priced hijinks end up happening outside the bar where you are basically at the mercy of some very clever little hustlers.

580,657855651a6d2c7052a6371c,"My bf and I came on a Friday night to celebrate my birthday. That was the first mistake. We had the calamari appetizer (thanks Yelp reviews for mentioning that) for checking in with Yelp and it was unbelievably good.  I could have (and should have) just had that as an entree and would've been happy.

Bf had fish (think it was swordfish not sure) and that is all he got.  One piece of fish and some decorative stuff on top. No side. Nothin.  We should have been tipped off when the waiter asked him if he wanted a side. Bf just assumed it came with one. If you're paying $20 + for an entree you just assume it comes with SOMETHING.  Anything some lettuce, parsley SOMETHING. When the waiter brought it we looked at each other in amazement. Then told the waiter you've got to be kidding. So bf ordered a side and now his entree is hovering around $25 UNBELIEVABLE.  The fish was good but not for that price.

 Thank God I got the fish and chips. I say to myself there's no way they can %$#^ that up.  And I was wrong.  I got 3 slender finger size pieces of fish.  Laying on top of fries in a bowl.  Everything lay in a little puddle of grease. I tried blotting the fish on napkins to get rid of the grease. Didn't work. So, I carefully peeled the sodden crust off each little piece of fish (the fish were each the size of a middle finger and that's what I give this restaurant) and with careful precision slid the fish out of its greasy wrapper.  Euuwww. 

And to add insult onto injury, waiter didn't even acknowledge my birthday.  Gee whiz, at least some places at least give you a cupcake with a candle. 

Never again.  Don't go here though the calamari appetizer is great just isn't worth sacrificing a whole expensive dinner for it.  That's the only reason I gave one star.",helpful,1,0

- Paper thin walls and huge gaps under the doors
- Power outages burnt out multiple sets of lights several times throughout the year
- Our AC system stopped working a 2 weeks into our lease because the rats chewed the wiring
- Problems with roaches even after exterminators came
- They refinished the floors in the renting office which caused our apartment to have a horrible chemical smell for more than 3 weeks. No heads up given to air out our apartment prior the job being done. Management claimed that they had no idea the office floors were being redone.
- I never got shutters in my room because the previous tenant took them. Several times I raised this issue to the management only to be told that they would get them and they never did. 
And to top it all off they claimed the majority of our deposit to redo the floors even though we didn't cause any damages to the floors.

After scheduling my appointment, receiving the email with required paperwork attached, completing and submitting paperwork, AND receiving a confirmation text two days before my appointment, I arrive to my appointment on time - actually 15 minutes early. And they ""can't find my appointment in the system"". Already skeptical but ok. I show the receptionist my confirmation text. She said she did have a new patient scheduled at that time slot but it wasn't me. She looks befuddled for several minutes, then goes to ask the therapist. Therapist Becky Truax comes out looking surprised I'm there because she allegedly tried to call me ""5 times"" (wrong) and tried to leave a message and when she didn't hear back, she canceled. She claimed to leave 5 voicemails and, checking even now, that is not accurate. She then alleged she was going to even offer to see me a week earlier. None of what she claimed made any sense because clearly they did something wrong in double booking or why was another person scheduled in the same time a lot as I? Also why did I receive a confirmation text two days ago if her alleged cancellation was more than a week ago, as evidenced by her claim that she wanted to offer me a slot a week earlier instead. You don't double book patients and then pick one arbitrarily to cancel unless you speak with and confirm it with them. What's worse is Becky was extremely condescending, scolding me ""well you should check your messages"". Even if I got that message I would not have been agreeable to it, however it would have saved me a trip and the hours of my life that I will now spend filing complaints and reviews.

I had the Eggs Benedict with pancetta and smoky Hollandaise. The eggs were poached perfectly. I mean PERFECTLY; warm and runny yolks, firm, but not rubbery, whites. Substituting pancetta for Canadian bacon? Well I'll never want to go back to bacon. The problem? The Hollandaise. No flavor. None. No tangy finish, no heat, nothing. The diced french-fried potatoes on the side? No  thanks. Too salty and too tiny, and thus difficult to eat. The muffin-ok, but nothing special. My better half had the Mediterranean chicken sandwich, good but not great. The flavors a little muted. 

As for service. We were led to a table in the corner, next to a table with two very large (think multiple seat-belt expander large) people at a tiny table for two. Why take us to a table were we'll feel cramped and will make these folks feel even more cramped, when there are so many open tables? We discretely asked for another table. Another party came in within minutes and were promptly led to that same cramped table in the corner! Our server rapidly rattled off the days specials and zipped away.

597,657855651a6d2c7052a63a5b,"First let me start by saying the location was not a problem. Fantastic location and nice little restaurant. Other people seem to have enjoy their stay here. My family and I on the overhand did not. 

During our wedding weekend and Mardi Gras stay with our sons the accommodations started out to be promising. Quaint old style place. That's about as far as it went. My wife and I had one room and pour boys stayed in the suite. 

The meals that was described in our email from Zac did not happen at all. The restaurant service was the poorest I have ever received. Not only were the meals prepared for you with their choice of food, there was no fruit or buffet style service as was paid for. On one morning we sat for ten minutes at a dirty table before my oldest soon finally got up and wiped it clean himself. We had to ask for coffee, water, drinks, and when told the waiter we wanted pancakes, we were told that our food was already being prepared by the chef. He sighed and acted so exasperated that we said ok to this. Food was brought but we had to ask for silverware and refills. One plate want delivered until the others were finished. We did not go back. 

Our room was cleaned the first day and freak towels placed. The boys room was never cleaned during the four day stay. We booked and paid for a five days but left early due to the service. 

On the third day we texted Zac about the housekeeping and was assured it would be addressed. We came back to find the bed had been made but no fresh towels were left, only wash clothes. The boys room again had not been touched. I texted Zac and was given the combination for the linen closet to retrieve towels. All that was in the closet were a few hand towels. We used these for the night and informed Zac. The next morning we departed early for parades. When we came back late afternoon we did find towels in our room but still not the boys. 

At this time we decided to go home early. I personally spoke with Zac about the conditions and the service and that we were leaving early. He asked his restaurant manager to listen to what I had to say. Excuses were given about new staff and if being Mardi Gras. He offered me a rain check for the day. I politely declined and told him I would accept a resins if he wanted to make amends. He advised me he would see what he could do. I also informed him that I had found a window pane broken in our room when we returned. 

9 days after our departure I recieved an email claiming the window was broke and a sofa cushion was missing. I replied that we had spoken about the window and offered up our conversation about my complaints again in case he did not recall. I was told that (1) I left of my own accord without notice for unknown reasons (2) the sofa cushion was missing and would I please return it (3) that I was the only guest that complained and if I left a poor review I would be ""exaggerating and fabricating"" my story. I don't know about you but those remarks are the same as calling me a thief and a liar. 

Today I came in from work after 3 weeks of being gone and decided to try to call Zac to rectify the missing cushion situation. He was rude and very disrespectful. Told me he remembered me and that I need to bring his cushion back. I explained I had no use for his cushion and had not taken it. He replied but telling me,  ""I'm gonna get you boy. I'm going to notify the police and your employer. I'm gonna get you nigger.""  

In closing, I will say that we spoke to other guest at the time we stayed and they had not recieved housekeeping either. They were french and Canadian so maybe standards are different where they live and didn't complain. I'm a native to Louisiana and have traveled quite extensively in the US and also to Central and South America. This was the worse treatment I have ever recieved during and most certainly after.

We selected a fruit tea and chose passion fruit and green apple syringes or test tubes. I can't remember which as science confuses me, but it was pretty darn good. We added a jelly for .50 cents more.

There are seats and some tables and games as in other Bubble Tea shops. Bubblelicious Lab should be a cool place for the younger crowd to hang out. I would and will go back to sharpen up my lab skills. There is also a hot option which will be a good choice in the cold weather.

I wouldn't say my expectations were high although we were looking for a place to eat and she been telling how their food is somewhat decent so I decided why not? As soon as we got there, I saw the menu and was already overwhelmed. Not that big of a problem to me since I like ordering more food than I should and trying a bit of everything. We got the soft bake salt and pepper squid and the spicy Japanese udon soup, both of which were surprisingly good. 

The reason why I'm giving them one star is because of there terrible, terrible, worst that I've ever experienced service. I ordered a Heineken and when I got it, it looked great and it was ice cold, but problem came when  I took a sip and realized how flat it was. No carbonation what so ever. I let my girlfriend have a sip and she agreed as well, it tasted awful and ha no carbonation, so we called over our waitress and told her that the beer was flat, she didn't understand much English so I just asked for a Sapporo instead. To my surprise, when I it the Sapporo, i had the same exact problem once again. This time I told the lady that the beer was flat and my girlfriend asked if we were going to e charged because the beer obviously was not good. So the waitress called the manager over and I explained to him that the beers they were serving were bad. He took the two bottles and walked away so I thought it was over with, but no, I was wrong. He came back with the same two bottles and two glasses and poured the beers into the cups to show me the foam and that it was fine. I looked at him with a crazy look and he kept insisting that the beers weren't old or bad, so I told him to take a sip and tell me if it tastes as it should, but he refused and just grabs the cups and bottles and said hell take it over the bill with a pissed off tone in his voice as if I did something wrong. After that, the manager sat behind the register along with his waiter and waitress and gave us dirty ass looks the entire time. For a while 30 minutes they stared and gave me the stank eye and ultimately made me uncomfortable. Not only that, but I guess the staff told the kitchen staff as well because every time I saw the peephole through the doors, there was an old lady staring back with the same if not, worst stare at us. lthough the food was decent, I will NOT becoming back here again with service like that especially coming from the manager and the peanut gallery he calls his staff.

I've been exploring the center city/ old city area for a good amount of years now and over the years, I've heard many many people claim that certain places had the best pizza in Philly. Through those trials, I've found some really good places, but I've never left a place saying ""This is it!"", until I found Pietro's... Pietro's is just pure heaven to me and though everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I will bet any amount of money that if their pizza is not the best you ever had, it will at least be one of the best that you ever had. The crust is always amazingly crunchy, the sauce is bold and flavorful, the sauce to cheese ratio is perfect, and the toppings are the freshest you'll find. The rest of the menu is great as well. For starters, the portions are huge! Especially their salads. And to add to that, everything is very rich and dense. I swear, no matter what you get, every bite is a party in your mouth. Lol. 

Aside from the food, Pietro's definitely looks like it's waaay more expensive than it actually is. The inside is very classy and quite beautiful. It has a great overall ambiance. The front dining room has has amazing vaulted ceilings and elegant light fixtures/ chandeliers. At the front of the dining area, near the entrance, there's a wall of massive windows that can be fully opened during the warmer seasons. On the outside of those Windows, you'll find the outdoor dining area. It's not that big, but the sidewalk on Walnut St. is very wide. So if you do opt for outdoor dining, it'll be quite comfortable and you won't be interupted by all the people walking by. Adjacent from the front dining room is the bar area. It's quite large and it's fitted with a few tv's. Behind the front dining room/ bar area and up a few stairs is another huge dining area that has views of the partially exposed kitchen. They also have very stylish restrooms that are extremely clean. 

All in all, every time that I've been to Pietro's, the service has been superb. And the same can be said about pretty much everything on the menu. My only complaint about Pietro's is though it's worth every penny, their pizza pies in particular can be a little pricey. I also dislike the fact that you cannot make any substitutions. But other than that, Pietro's is a solid Italian restaurant and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. And lastly, for a place that has such great quality/ authentic Italian food, they get extra points for since they deliver as well.",helpful,1,0

618,657855651a6d2c7052a642b2,"Can I just start off by saying how disappointed I am with the lack of hospitality and respect that the managing staff at this establishment has? I have never been spoken to so rudely and promptly HUNG UP ON while speaking to one of the managers.

I called in last week inquiring a mistake in how much I was charged on my happy hour items. Although the server, Jake, could not read the tip amount exactly, the total was put down as $10. I tipped 15.6% which I felt was appropriate considering the fact that it was only happy hour drinks. I was, instead, charged $15 total which resulted in a 73.4% tip. Does it make any sense that they would choose to go by what they thought they could read on the tip line instead of following the total amount that was clearly written down, which, again, was $10?! I hadn't received a refund back all week after previously talking to a manager named Ryan, so I called back in today before they opened so I could catch them before their dinner rush (if they even have one) to be considerate. I was very nice and didn't mind being put on hold for them to search for the bill in their system, and when I had readdressed the issue to another manager, Brian, he asked if the service was bad or if there were any issues with the meal. I figured this was standard managerial concern. I kindly told him that it was not the service, but rather that we just wanted a refund back for the mistake. He, THEN, has the nerve to tell me, ""if you're going to be a cheap tipper, then you're not welcome in our restaurant"". WHAT?! First of all, any business that tells ME how to TIP is a business I will never be returning to. Second, the amount that I had tipped was nothing out of the ordinary! If all I had was drinks, all the server did for me was deliver it from the bar to my table. That sounds like an ignorant statement but I have served in upscale restaurants in the past and wouldn't mind a 15% tip for that!

Quick side note: let me source a ""traveler's tipping guide"" for the city of Philadelphia. http://www.myfoxphilly.com/story/686949/travelers-tipping-guide
It clearly states bartenders usually receive 10-15% and servers receive 15-20%. So, my 15% tip is a perfectly good amount for the service I received.

I, unfortunately, got off the phone before realizing the exact percentage of tip I had paid and called them back to explain to them that 15% was not a low tip at all and Brian's personal opinion about a low tip should not result in his saying that I should not return. As I was speaking to him to kindly complain about how I felt about his rudeness, he had the audacity to say, ""goodbye"" and HANG UP ON ME AS I WAS SPEAKING. I have never been so appalled by their lack of ability to be hospitable and to cater to my concerns in a way that a customer serviced-geared businesses should.

However, please please please beware, the chairs outside are not sturdy at all.  I am not a small woman and sitting in those wobble chairs made me feel like I was going to fall.  Needless to say, we moved inside. 

The service was quick inside, we ordered and got our food within 15 minutes.  I ordered a mojito to drink and it was mostly juice... now that I think about it I wonder if I needed to specifically instruct them to put alcohol in it because I tasted none. Whatsoever. 

The food was ok, but it could be improved.  My friend got the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was a little overcooked and stringy.  I got the shrimp and grits.  I was impressed with the grits and the seasoning on the shrimp was delicious.  The dish was RUINED by the onions on top. There were quite a few mixed in as well, so I had to fish them out. It literally tasted like they cooked the outside of the onion that you were supposed peel off and throw away.  I literally chewed them and spit them out because there were not edible.

624,657855651a6d2c7052a644cd,"Unfortunately my experience with Larsen's was the worst of all of the pool builders with whom I chose to have bid on my project.  Let me start by saying that Eric and the people that work at his company with whom I had the pleasure of speaking come off as genuinely nice and it felt like talking with family at initial contact.  Our designer, Jeff, started off the process at our home by bringing us a small Larsen's Pool beach ball, which my daughter loved.  However, my concerns with the company grew very quickly from that point on.  Jeff's primary job was clearly not with Larsen's Pool as his voicemail called out first that he was a DJ and then that he worked for Larsen's.  His responsiveness on the project was also very indicative of this as it was extremely difficult to get a response from him and he consistently missed promised deadlines to have designs or quotes, by a week or more, when he promised to have me something the next day.  At one point, I finally called to speak to Eric Larsen directly because of the problem.  What I was told was that the company was having trouble getting together with their rock guy on the waterfall and coping portion of our project.  Apparently they had 1 rock guy and they hadn't heard from him in weeks and were not even sure if he still lived in the area.  Massive red flag!  When the project is about doing something naturalistic and you don't have a good option to deliver on that, it should be communicated up front and not a month later.  In addition to the issues with reaching their rock installer, Eric confessed that they really didn't do many pools with rock, perhaps only 3 in his years with the company.  I'm not really sure why this had not come up in my initial discussion with him, but I was not a happy camper after hearing that statement a month into the process.  I asked them to go ahead and just quote the pool with a basic waterfall that he said his guys could install on their own and then the rest of the design that they could do based on what I was looking to have done.  What I got as a quote a few days later was excessively high.  The quote (without everything I was trying to have done, which I had on my other quotes), was the highest by roughly 25% more than my finalists.  Even after their ""Angie's List"" discount, they came in 11% higher, again, not including all of the rock work.  If I did a like for like, Larsen's would have been roughly 20% more than all other pool companies I spoke with during the process.  In their defense, they did make the comment (both the owner and the designer) that they are typically higher priced than everyone else.  Overall, working with Larsen's was unbelievably frustrating due to a major lack of communication given their 5 star ratings, but what I found interesting (even though they do provide a substantial list of references for both new builds and remodels) was that of all of the people I knew and our various asks in community groups across social media, anytime Larsen's was mentioned, it was always in the same capacity...""I've heard they are good"" or ""they are highly rated""...but nobody had actually used them or known anyone that had.  This isn't to say that the work that they do is not good....it may very well be, but to not be able to find anyone that had used them when they have been operating for so many years in the bay area was a bit strange.  In the end, there are too many other good builders in the area that I would just skip going back to Larsen's if I had to go through the process again.",helpful,1,0

Let me set the stage for you: a sprawling ""salad bar"" with so much more than salads, calling your name from the middle of the elegant dining room. Olives, charcuterie, pasta, fruit, sauces, a whole plate of just bacon, and a to-die-for mushroom risotto are just a few of the treasures you'll find at the ""market table"", which is included with dinner. I recommend getting a few items, including plain white jasmine rice, to set at the table and sample with the main attraction: THE MEAT.

Everyone gets a little round card that is green on one side (""more please!"") and red on the other (""I've had just about enough, thank you!"") As long as that little card is green-side-up, you will be frequently greeted by the friendliest gentlemen wielding big spits of all sorts of meat! They nearly RUN to the table, place the meat in front of you, and ask very kindly if you would like to try (insert delicious cut here.) And how can you say no to ANY of it?? Garlic steak, parmesan pork, rib eye, leg of Lamb, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, bacon-wrapped filet mignon (Homer Simpson drool) and so so so much more. Nearly everything we tried elicited a purely primal response: body melt, eyes roll back, uncontrollable moaning. I'm sure we were a sight to see, but it was all SO GOOD. With nearly every cut, you can taste the flame without compromising the flavor of the meat. Even with our card red-side-up, our favorite meat chauffeur caught us coveting something he was holding and lovingly stopped by to offer us a piece. And again... how can we say no??

This place is a phenomenal date night spot in terms of atmosphere, presentation, and sheer flavor. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is our server was rude and impatient.

Visiting Nashville with some friends who live there, I was really hoping for a tour of great local establishments. I knew I struck gold when we showed up at San Antonino Taco Co. Even just walking up onto the massive outdoor patio I knew this place was going to be great.

See, in Seattle there are few places where you can eat outside because it rains so much that an outdoor deck area is wasted space 9 months out of the year. I fell in love with the fact that you could choose to eat inside or out, and both spaces were equally large. I imagined late nights here in the summer, loud people, big meals, and tons of fun. 

Then I fell in love all over again with their cute ordering system. There's a long hall where people line up to place orders. Sort of like Customs at the airport, you're outfitted with a paper menu and a mini pencil so you can input your order and just walk it up to the counter when you're ready. No more standing in line behind people who don't know what they're doing! (Which would have been me.) Instead I got to take a ton of time looking over the menu and thinking up a million different lunch options for myself without wasting anyone else's time.

Once I decided on some soft and hard shell tacos, my friend insisted we get sweet teas and queso. Queso isn't a ""thing"" anywhere I've lived so I was totally down. Sweet tea sounded like a good idea but ""sweet' didn't begin to explain just *HOW* insanely sweet this stuff would be. But from what I understand it's super authentic. So I drank mine and enjoyed it for the tourist factor.

The tacos were great, the queso was outstanding and the whole experience was a ton of fun. I don't think I could have said I saw any of Nashville if I hadn't stopped in here at least once to eat. In fact, I'm certain I can't come back without going here to eat again!",helpful,1,0

I managed to find a really old beat up TV tray and a holey dented suitcase that had the lining ripped out of it. I wanted to purchase these things to use for a test run in an attempt  to build a suitcase table/nightstand I was thinking of and didn't want to invest a lot of money not knowing if it would work.
None of the items i wanted were priced and given their condition (trashy) I thought I could take them home for $5 or so. I took them to the counter and after explaining to the woman attendant that there were no prices and I was happy to offer $5 she carefully inspected every piece. I thought she would notice the missing lining, the hole in the side of the suitcase and the overall poor state of the early 80s aluminum TV tray.
She told me she'd sell me the suitcase for $5 and the tray for $3. I thought this was a little steep and mentioned that there were other suitcases in much better condition for sale in the store for only $3. Before I could finish my thought she took the suitcase away from me and placed it on the restock shelf and told me that I was welcome to come back to the store ""when I had the money"" that she requested. 
I hadn't denied the sale nor did I give any attitude at all when I offered to pay $3 instead of 5 for a suitcase that should have just been trash in the first place. 
She then walked away from the conversation all together leaving me dumbfounded and confused.
Honestly, had she politely stated that there was nothing she could do and maintained a pleasant demeanor, I would have paid the asking price, but her unsolicited attitude really rubbed me the wrong way. (My mama taught me asking was free and always worth a shot...apparently not in this case)

We ate the traditional basket of crab fries, which are very good, but that was about it.  I ordered a shrimp sandwich since they are known for seafood but was mediocre at best.  We also ordered cheesesteak nachos which were low on flavor ad well as chips. I am not fond of eating nachos with a fork. It seems unnatural!  I was also disappointed when we got our bar bill. The specialty drink menu did not have prices, but I figured around $7 is pretty standard for a mixed drink.

Glad we didnt!  I was also disappointed with sending out our food as it is ready.  It is totally lame to watch another person eat while you sit there twiddling your thumbs.

Due to the two very friendly female staffers, the gorgeous weather, the adorable outside seating, the chill hipster crowd eating & conversing in the sunshine, & the Hispanic music, this eatery of 1 year & 3 months almost earns 4 stars.

HOWEVER, if I am to rate Bodega on the reason it exists (for FOOD & DRINK), it earns two stars. It was a little DISAPPOINTING, to say the least. (Three stars is the compromise.) I did love the vibe, but a vibe w/o great cuisine is just a vibe. 

There's NO smoothie menu, & the varieties are not listed anywhere -- how strange. I listened to the sweet staffer as she spoke of the available smoothies, & I opted for the smoothie that had the word ""berries"" in it. For $7.05 (not cheap!), I got a smoothie made w/ almond milk. (I opted out of whole milk.) 

It looked absolutely GORGEOUS! But it tasted HORRIBLE -- I swear I tasted COFFEE GROUNDS! And I detest coffee! It was so bad that I tossed the entire drink the moment I arrived home. What the heck was in that smoothie?!!

I should have gone w/ the famed Cuban sandwich (especially after the staffer claimed it's Bodega's best seller), but the $9 coconut marinated chicken sandwich w/ avocado & fresh mango (POLLO ASADA) just sounded too good not to try. 

Unfortunately for me, the sandwich was w/o merit. It had almost NO avocado & NO mango flavor-- see pic! It was practically FLAVORLESS & the chicken was not consistent throughout the sandwich-- some bites had it, some didn't. Really NO FLAVOR to this sandwich! One of the worst I've ever been served.

I had a coke which was $2.29 - which is not like super expensive, but at the same time, it was practically half the cost of my MEAL. So it seemed a little wrong. But they have to make their money somehow. And that's how.

I noticed they had all these options to add pie to your entree which I thought was odd, and then I saw in the fine print that they are somehow affiliated with Marie Callendar's. I don't think there are Marie Callendar's on the east coast, but they are all over California. So if you are looking for something like that - this is it. Now I didn't try the pie, but it looks great and if it's anything like Marie's it will be

Although I love the variety of items sold, their prices are definitely higher than if you went elsewhere, like Michaels or Joann's. The particular reason for my low rating on this visit, however, was the employees. There were many employees stocking shelves during my visit, many pushing items on carts. About 4 times during my visit, someone came down the aisle that I was in, pushing a cart, and I had to move out of the way to let them past. This would not have been a big deal except the employees did not say ""excuse me"" or ""I'm sorry"" or even acknowledge me. They seemed annoyed that I was in their way, which I found kind of rude. Also my cashier was not pleasant either. After I paid for my item, I said ""thank you!"" and she said nothing...all she said to me was ""hi"" and the price of my item.

I came in for a light lunch.  I ordered a rainbow roll and my favorite sashimi, hokki clam.

Obviously rolls vary from place to place but there are some pretty standard ones where you know what you were getting, a rainbow roll being one of them.

Rainbow rolls are so named because of the various colors from different sushi and avocado.  Sometimes some smelt roe or other colorful additives will be used for additional color.  Hana's horrible roll with the worst tasting fish I've ever seen had Hershey's Chocolate Sauce and some Vanilla sauce spread on it!  (See pictures)

Now for the really bad.

Hokki clam is my favorite.  It a red and white colorful clam that is a little chewy.  The four pieces of hokki clam I was served were so old and defrosted that I was afraid to eat them for safety.  They were brown and pale red (see pictures) and wilted.

I actually braved one for a few chews and almost threw up.  I finally got the (hispanic) sushi chef's attention and asked him what he meant by serving this to me.  He said that he did indeed just defrost them in the microwave (thanks for that honesty) but that he didn't know if they were bad or not!?!

I asked him how a ""sushi chef"" sending out raw seafood could ever, ever ever take the risk sending out unfresh or possibly rotten raw shellfish to a customer.  He was scared of my raised voice and sheepishly shrugged and slinked away.

He took the hokki clam off of my bill even though I also questioned him about the disgusting rainbow roll and sent a cut up orange to say he was sorry.

First, I booked a color and partial highlight, and thought I'd conveyed exactly what I wanted to the stylist (overall lighter, keep the color away from anything orange or red). I showed her a couple photos I found on Pinterest and she agreed she understood what I wanted. 

She said the overall lighter color would need much more time than my 3.5 hour appointment but it would be lighter than what we were starting with. I was willing to spend the time and money but she couldn't commit to it, even after admitting there wasn't a client right behind me for an appointment. Oh. Ok....? 

My request for lighter hair wasn't unrealistic, I've gotten the results I wanted from other stylists who were actually paying attention and knew their chemistry. I feel this communication just didn't happen here. 

Secondly, when toning she mentioned that she was using a semi-permanent toner and not a ""regular"" toner. Uhm....Why? I'm paying for permanent change to my hair! 

Now that my hair has been out in the natural light for a couple days, I'm just sick over it. My hair turned out exactly how I did NOT want it: Orange/red overall tone and looking brassy. I paid a lot of money at this Aveda salon to have it done professionally, yet I feel it looks like a bad box color dye job. Embarrassing. 

A full refund would be great, because I'm now going to have to have my hair color corrected at another salon. This shouldn't happen at a place like 21 North. Highly disappointed in my experience here and the awful result which I believe can be attributed to the stylist. Although she was pretty nice, she missed the mark completely with my hair color which can only be remedied by color correction at another salon.

We arrived around 10 AM and planned to just park and head into the city, but when I went in to confirm with the front desk that it was okay to leave my vehicle prior to check-in, they informed me that they had rooms available, gave me the keys and allowed us into our room. Very impressed with that, and it was a precursor of a very nice stay. This is a pretty good property, as long as you come in with your expectations appropriately set.

 ***PROS*** -Very good location! There's very little in the immediate vicinity (although Cherry St. Pier is right across the street and D&B's is right down the road), but it's an easy 15-20 minute walk or a $10 Uber to Old City or a 10 minute to Penn's Landing. -Views! Be sure to pony up the few extra $$$s for a Riverview room. It's worth it! -Room condition. Our room was exactly what we expect from a HIE: clean, comfortable, plenty of room. Nothing fancy, but it delivers what it promises!

 ***CONS*** -It can get LOUD here. Half the rooms face I-95, the river view rooms face Columbus Boulevard. Staying on a Friday night, there were quite a few street races and ATVs blasting down the Boulevard off and on from about 10 PM all the way to 2-3 AM. Even on the 6th floor and with the sound machine that we travel with on, we were woken up several times. -Parking. At $30 a night, it's pricey for open lot parking.

It was nice to see a nearly fully stocked breakfast buffet again, but there were very little mitigation measures in place, and no one present to correct the guests who ignored what Was expected (several guests walking back up to the buffet maskless, touching items then putting them back, etc.).

Glad that I made reservations weeks in advance because the restaurant was PACKED! Came here with a few coworkers and we ordered a variety of plates and shared.

Buttermilk Fried Breast of Chicken ($27)
3 big fried chicken breast pieces was served on top of bourbon mashed sweet potatoes, sauteed sugar snap peas, topped with country ham cream gravy. The chicken breast slices were very thick, and unfortunately the first piece we cut into was RAW. Ugh! Raw chicken! We sent the plate back right away - the servers were very apologetic. Unfortunately it took them almost 15-20 min to have a fresh plate back out to us so one person had to eat alone - totally rushed! Plus - the food wasn't spectacular - maybe it was the raw chicken effect.

Grilled Pork Chop ($29)
A GIGANTIC pork chop on top of brown sugar glazed sweet potatoes topped with toasted pecans and caramelized onion reduction sauce. Beautiful presentation! The pork chop was delicious but probably due to the huge size, was a little dry. Plus we ordered ours done (and probably should have ordered it medium). My coworkers complained that the sweet potatoes were too sweet for an entree side - but I polished them off :)

Garlic Crusted Drum ($30)
A nice piece of breaded drum cooked to a crispy texture on a wood burning oven. Drum was served with brabant potatoes, crimini mushrooms, and bacon. I'm a little biased here because I personally don't like the texture of the drum - it's a chewy, wet fish (I like my fish flaky or meaty). But the garlic breading was flavorful and crispy. This dish was a favorite around the table - just not for me!

Decaf Cappuccino ($5.50)
We saw so many people order a cappuccino or espresso - so we keeled! Delicious way to end the night - a nice, creamy, rich cappuccino! Prices range from $5-12

NOLA Banana Pudding Layer Cake ($7)
Loved all the banana pudding in NOLA so had to order this dessert - and talk about layers. This cake had so many delicious layers of banana pudding, banana, cream, graham cracker crust - then repeat! All drizzled with chocolate fudge! DELICIOUS! Not too sweet - perfect for my taste buds!

Apparently my college gf had her adorable chubby daughter's bday party at the carousel.

Apparently all the horses go up and down unlike the one in City Park Storyland but I did not investigate fully to check on this.  Another bonus is that when it is cold like it was this past Saturday, you can close the entrances save one to keep it warm!  They also have benches to put the food, cake etc. and they supply huge trash cans.  It was pretty fun!  The kids and adults all had fun!

Now, keep in mind that the park gets EXTREMELY busy at times.  My gf tried to warn me that this weekend there was a lacrosse tournament but little did we all know that over 60 teams would be descending in the park and would make parking almost impossible!

678,657855651a6d2c7052a640fb,"I was craving Thai summer rolls.  Had I not remembered reading some decent Yelp reviews for this place I would have passed it by given the location in a seedy strip mall.  Bottom line from our experience: Chiang Mai isn't a bad place to stop if you're in the area for food that is Southeast Asian or Chinese in concept if not authentic in execution.  It isn't a place we'll go back to again but glad we tried it.  Once.

Let's start with the GOOD THINGS:. 

1) Summer rolls were freshly filled and expertly rolled.  I would have been a bigger fan if they contained some SE Asian herbs in the mix, like cilantro, Thai basil and mint instead of only lettuce as the greens element.   I liked the dipping sauce served with them was a vinegar tart, sweet, salty offering (although not fish sauce prominent as one might find for traditional nuac cham)  instead of  peanut sauce.  I used  red chili paste on the table to add spicy heat to the mix. 

2) Very friendly service.  It seemed virtually a wave of people were leaving through the narrow entry as we tried to enter just after 1:00 and  we had the then advantage of few tables being occupied and attentive servers.  Food was delivered promptly with hot food served hot and cold food served cold.

3) Decent seating options including booths with elephant pattern woven tablecloths topped with glass or formica topped tables and chairs all at standard height.

4) Music selection on the sound system of rock ancients like Jim Morrison and Mick Jagger.  (Embarrasingly, I know all the lyrics to all the songs and wanted to sing along.)   Set at at a low enough level to know it was there but not to override all else.

5) Prices were low ($19 before tax for three dishes at lunch) and servings were large.  But I'd rather have higher prices and smaller servings of better food. 

Now the 'NOT SO MUCH' things:

1) Like many Thai restaurants in the area the menu seems an amalgam of Chinese - American and Thai items with the latter tamed down from the robust flavors I have enjoyed at Thai restaurants in cities like Portland, San Franciso, Las Vegas or even my former hometown of Bend.  For a city of Bosie's size it is surprising to find so many Asian restaurants don't ""pick a lane and drive in it"" for authentic food.

2)  The food is just OK ""minus"".  Pad Thai is one of those dishes I am almost ashamed to hear myself order as it is sometimes so poorly done, but when it is well made it is a treasure.  It was on the lunch menu here and so I ordered it as a good litmus test for any Thai restaurant which arguably ought to get this rice noodle dish right.  (Like say an Italian restaurant's ability to turn out spaghetti marinara right.)  This was not the worst Pad Thai I've ever had, but it was not good either.

My husband veered to a Chinese food item selecting Hoonan (not a typo, that is how it appeared on menu) vegetables.  The mix of veggies, which included bok choy, napa cabbage and pea pods, was cooked to just right  toothsome doneness.   Oversauced, but that seems to be a trend  in Chinese - American food service,  with too much soy sauce in the mix of things, another trend, and just barely a hint of the Hunan heat as promised on the menu. 

3) The infrastructure of the restaurant looks like it is falling apart, from the parking lot through the door and all around.  Which may be nothing the restaurant owners can do anything about unless they own the building.

4) Getting in the door can be a challenge at the narrow entry as people are going out and you are coming in given they have a host station set up as ""traffic stop"".  It is awkward and uninviting.  This they could fix.

THIS N THAT:

1) PARKING:  The ramshakle lot shows looks rode hard and put away wet, but it is a lot with parking and that is a good thing in spite of the condition.

2) NEIGHBORS:  Bar to the left, Asian Market 2 to the right.  The latter is an interesting place if you're trying to find some harder to find SE Asian ingredients like shrimp paste or a choice of half a dozen plus brands of fish sauce.

3)  ACCESSIBILITY:  One blue wheelchair marked spot in the entire lot is outside the Asian Market.  It is not van accessible.  Restaurant is level in and throughout.  Table seating is standard height.  Adequate path of travel to several tables.",helpful,1,0
679,657855651a6d2c7052a6400a,"Had an unconventional experience getting a lease. I arranged a time with the rep I worked with in the past however he was responding to his texts during a test drive. We agreed to meet at 2pm and he did not arrive until 2:20 because he was doing a test drive. Although I waited by his area, he relocated me where I sat there for an hour. He was periodically checking in but my discussions were under 30 seconds as he was working with another customer. 

He sent his ""manager"" over with numbers showing for a vehicle I wasn't looking at. The sales rep knew my situation from the previous conversation but none of that was relayed until I had to clarify. 

I sat for another 30 minutes. 

Overall, after this lease is complete, I will not be working with another toyota dealership. The product is good, but some people can tarnish an image.

I arrived there by 2, and left there by 4, when I told the rep I had to be gone no later than 3:30. They are not cognizant of the customers time and a proper sales rep would prioritize their customers or make further arrangements. 

These professionals are in it for themselves and while 99% of the time, Del Toyota provides great service. This specific transaction left a VERY BAD taste in my mouth.

By the end of the transaction, I did not see the contract terms until I was with the finance Manger.

685,657855651a6d2c7052a6409c,"[Note: this is a review from a few months ago which somehow got saved instead of posted, so the date isn't particularly relevant.]

The food here was very good, but the entire experience was riddled with problems and inconveniences mostly created by an unprofessionally run establishment.

From the moment we walked in, things got awkward.  A man I assume was the owner (given his more lax attire) was berating the hostess for not knowing how to count while some customers stood around waiting for her attention (and more importantly, for him to just drop his point about what appeared to be a simple misunderstanding).

The enormous specials menu was nowhere to be seen in writing, but a thickly accented man was nice enough to come over to our very loud corner and rattle off a bunch of Italian words with such dismissive and incredible speed that he left me wondering if he was just bitter about being stuck in his second-choice vocation behind auctioneer.

So, resigning ourselves to ordering off the written menu, we asked our waiter about an appetizer we all wanted to try.  We explained we weren't that hungry, but this one thing looked great, so could we split it four ways.  He said it was small, so we should probably get two.  We followed his advice, and wound up with surprisingly large appetizer portions.  I felt a little ripped off, as he just sold us another 17 dollar dish by essentially lying about its size.

The main course had the opposite problem, portions so small I felt ripped off.  What a roller coaster!  But it was actually pretty tasty stuff.

Upon leaving I discovered we had been there for a VERY long time; looking back on the evening, I realized every single part of the experience had taken longer than it should, from getting seated to getting our orders taken to getting our food to the spacing between the appetizer and the entree.

Look, someone in the kitchen clearly knows how to cook, which is the only reason for that second star in this rating.  But whoever is running the place (I'm guessing the angry gentlemen I encountered upon arrival) needs to seriously rethink quite a few of the finer points of business and human resources.",helpful,1,0

If you've ever been to Fresh Kitchen you'll know what to expect from Taco Dirty. You walk through a line where you can choose bases, veggies, proteins, sauce, etc. I'm going to throw out there that I am a huge fan of Fresh Kitchen. I actually went to Fresh Kitchen a couple days before and a couple days after going to Taco Dirty. To me, and this is completely my personal taste, Taco Dirty ranks lower than Fresh Kitchen. I cannot handle spice and I managed to choose some spicy options (I think it was the chilled avocado and mole noodles.) Also, my choices didn't blend together as seamlessly as at Fresh Kitchen. Part of that could be what I chose, but I also would assume everything should taste great together (it tasted good, but not great.) I still give this place five stars because being on a soy free/dairy free diet, when I go out to eat I'm usually super limited, but here I can eat almost everything!

This is a new restaurant so the workers weren't fully aware of what is soy free. However, they are super helpful and the guy grabbed a book and walked me through every single item and if it was soy free. This was even with a line forming behind me. The people behind me may have suffered but I really appreciated that. This is what I ended up getting:

Avocado citrus rice, chilled avocado and mole noodles
Sweet potato hash and avocado crispy broccolini
Grilled lime and sour orange chicken, bbq tinga chicken
Pickled pineapple onions and warm vegan cauli queso
Orange guac sauce

Like I said earlier, everything on its own was great, it just tasted kind of weird together. I would definitely forgo the noodles next time because I think that was what gave it the kick. I loved the pickled pineapple onions and would definitely get it again. The warm vegan cauli queso is cool in theory, but I didn't feel like it really added to my dish so I'd skip it next time. Same with the orange guac sauce. I want to find a sauce I love here as much as the creamy ginger sauce at FK.

I was also able to eat the chips and salsa! I definitely enjoyed that. 

The décor is really neat - avocados everywhere! There is limited indoor and outdoor seating, but the entire time we were here it never seemed like people didn't have a seat as long as they were willing to sit outside.

Anyways, we were given menus and then ended up ordering:

Taro Smoothie, $3.25 prior to tax- My husband ordered this. This drink was on the sweet side and would ask if the sweetness level can be adjusted. Also this drink was powdery at times and would not recommend getting drinks here. 

Bok Choy With Fresh Garlic, $8.95 prior to tax- Tasty bok choy that is large enough to share with 4 people. Great garlic flavor but was oily. We did not finish this and had leftovers. 

Noodle With Peanut Sauce, $4.25 prior to tax- I opted for this dish since I prefer dry style noodles over noodles in a soup. I decided to get my noodles hand drawn (or hand pulled). But you can also choose knife cut, which makes for an even chewier texture. I liked the sauce that was used in this dish. Although this dish appears to be small, it was a perfect size for one person. 

Beef Tendon Noodle Soup, $8.50 prior to tax- My husband ordered this, as a recommendation from our friend who has dined here a few years before. He opted for the hand drawn style noodles too and thought it was a good texture for him. The tendons were tender and the soup was flavorful. A great portion for one but really could be shared with another person.

I took my year old lab mix to The Spayed Club Clinic to be neutered on 12-Mar-2015.  Family members had taken previous pets there approximately a year prior with no issues therefore upon their recommendation I was happy to bring my pet to this facility.  

When I dropped him off for the overnight procedure he was taken from me immediately in an effort to keep multiple pets out of the waiting room at one time.  I was not given the opportunity to say goodbye before his overnight procedure, however I quickly moved pase this, filled out his paperwork, was given pick up instructions and left. 

I arrived to pick him up the next morning, and was HORRIFIED when he was brought out to me covered in feces (after payment was tendered).  He was shaking and smelled terrible, with feces across his face, ears, behind and clumped up the underside of his tail.  I inquired with an associate who was rude and provided no explanation.  I commented that I would need to bathe him and was rudely told that he could not be bathed because of his procedure. I tried to inquire further but was rushed out the door because the cat drop off time was quickly approaching.  

When I arrived home, I attempted to clean my dog who was violently shaking and would not come out of the corner of the room.  Because I could not bather him, I used pet wipes and pet dry shampoo however the feces were so embedded in his fur I was forced to cut it out. My very happy, social pet has been anti-social since his departure from the facility. I will not be taking any future pets to this facility and will recommend the same to family and friends resulting from both the condition my pet was returned to me and the lack of quality service provided during my experience.",helpful,1,0

The hubby and I went back last night after our first visit was seriously so good and we could not stop raving about this place. They didn't have any beer on tap, as their tap was broken. We ordered the ribeye but wanted to upgrade to the wagyu sirloin. Was later told that they were out, so we still stuck with the regular ribeye and pan seared garlic potatoes. We also ordered the pork belly lollipops because those were seriously SO GOOD last time. Although our server was personable and friendly, he forgot to put our order in. So our appetizer came out after our main meals. We ordered the ribeye medium rare, and both of ours were cooked well done. At this point, we're starving since it took about 40-45 mins for our meal to come out and our appetizer didn't come out until about 50 mins of waiting. The pan seared garlic potatoes were flavorless. This is coming from me who loves her potatoes in every way possible (tots, hash, fries, baked, mashed, etc) I couldn't even finish the potatoes. It seemed like they needed a lot of salt and garlic. Since they are pan seared garlic potatoes.... We were truly sad about the pork belly lollipops. Last time we had them, they were so tender and just melted in your mouth. This time, they were very tough and hard to chew. We didn't even finish them! It really broke my heart. So I'm hoping that last night was just an off night. But now I'm not sure if we'll return.

Eason was very rude to me, and although he became available to do my nails first, he decided that he was going to do another young lady's pedicure first and then do her nails.

Ordered the Lamb Lahm Bajeen Manakeesh, Spinach and Cheese Manakeesh, and the Gluten Free Platter that comes with hummus, baba ghannoush, falafel, fattoush, and grape leaves.

Delivery was faster than expected which was an awesome surprise since I was starving.  The estimated delivery time was about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes, but delivery arrived around 45 mins.  Awesome!

Now this is where they lose stars.  They deliver their flatbreads, folded in half.  So it's more like a quesadilla than a pizza.  I would recommend that maybe they could invest in some recyclable pizza boxes for their Manakeesh items, so these could be delivered flat.  I was able to unfold the lamb one, but the spinach and cheese was a fail because all the toppings ended up on one side.  Definitely disappointed by this.

I did like the flavors/spices in the lamb.  The spinach and cheese was nothing spectacular to report.  Also, the platter was pretty standard.  I've definitely had better falafel and I had to reheat them since all the other items of the platter were cold which made the falafel arrive cold as well.  Enjoyed the baba ghannoush and the stuffed grape leaves. 

All in all, I would have rather ordered an amazing pizza from somewhere else and be more content with that, then with what I've sampled from here, especially if you compare that with the money that was spent on the above.  
I won't be ordering delivery again, but would be up to  going and having a sit-down meal at this spot.",helpful,1,0

We ordered the wu xi dumplings and it had an umami shrimp taste. So good! I definitely recommend this one. It was the tastiest of the dishes we ordered. The crispy salted chicken over rice was really good. Crispy breading but tender inside. I got the fish fillet in chili sauce but found that the taste wasn't too remarkable. The dish had a generous amount of cabbage and the fish fillet pieces were so tender and soft. Don't get this dish if you don't like a numbing feeling afterwards.

Last night my husband and a good friend and I shared in a wonderful meal, with top-notch service by Woody & many others.

After a round of delicious fresh-fruit laden cocktails (blood orange, blackberries, basil, lemon) we sat at a lovely table overlooking a snow-covered Rittenhouse square.  (We could see doggies playing in the snow!)

After an amuse-bouche of squab, fois-gras and horseradish foam, we had some appetizers.  My friend has the LaCroix Salad, and I enjoyed the Lamb carpaccio.

Another amuse of yellowtail was brought, followed by a lovely, simple beef consomme with a few pieces of udon, mushrooms and a single raw oyster that was gently cooked by the broth.

The main course was truly the star of the show.  DH enjoyed perfectly cooked shortribs accompanied by ricotta filled pierogie (yum!), our friends had a simple chicken and I again indulged in a lovely duck sous-vide.

Wrong food was delivered. Meat was served at the wrong temperature. Food was delivered at different times at the same table. The apps laced flavor.

763,657855651a6d2c7052a6432f,"Alternative medicine, to my understanding, includes looking at someone with a holistic approach.  Unfortunately my experience with Dr. Garcia was anything but holistic.

Twenty minutes after my scheduled 10am appointment, Dr. Garcia escorted me back to his office. He sat at his office chair looking at the laptop on his lap and asked brusquely, ""What are you here for?""  This is the approach I would fully expect from a conventional doctor, but not from someone who practices alternative medicine.

Since I am hypothyroid and need my prescription renewed, I need current blood work done.  He suggested that this be done in his office right now.  I'm not a medical expert, but I have had blood drawn several times a year for the past several years and EVERY time I'm told to not only fast, but also don't take my thyroid medication because it will throw off results.  I was concerned and confused that Dr. Garcia was going to make a determination on my prescription with blood drawn right there on the spot.

When I mentioned that my cortisol was very high a few years ago, Dr. Garcia made a sweeping statement that my adrenal system is shot.  Again, an assumption I would expect from a conventional doctor.  My expectation of someone who practices alternative medicine is that they would inquire about what external factors were going on in my life at that time, and what are your cortisol levels now?  Had Dr. Garcia done that, he would have learned that I was going through a divorce at that time, and labs since then have shown that everything in that area is fine.

At the end of our consultation he wrote a list on the back of a piece of scratch paper (I'm not making this up!), which included ""diet and supplements"" as my course of action, along with a number of treatments he offers.  When I inquired about which supplements I should take, he said he sells a package.  Again, I inquired about which supplements I should use, because I'm already taking a few things.  Instead of giving me a clear answer he wanted me to list what I am taking and he'll let me know if I should take it or not.  ""Or you can just buy my package.""  I'm guessing he has considerable markup on his package and other office treatments.

After about 45 minutes, I knew a lot about Dr. Garcia's view of mammography and thermography (how did that even come up?), about his supplements, about his other body cleanse services, about his cancer patients (the bulk of his business, it appears), and he knew very little about me or my life situation.  How can a doctor take a holistic approach if they don't even have half of my story?  I felt like I was just another dollar sign passing through his office, much like his terminal cancer patients.  Unfortunately, I did make a considerable contribution to Utopia on this initial consultation, but I won't repeat that mistake.

I thought I had done my research.  Dr. Garcia's website said all of the right things.  I wish I had had someone else's experience to draw on before making my appointment.

768,657855651a6d2c7052a64131,"I really love the dentists and hygienists at Champagne and I have received excellent care. However,like the other reviewers, I have had issues with  the  office staff.  They continue to estimate my  insurance coverage incorrectly.  This week they charged my husband for a cleaning  that was covered at 100% by insurance, and when I was finally convinced them they made a mistake, instead of issuing a credit to my account for the amount he over-paid,  they inadvertently debited my account a second time!  I understand that mistakes can happen, and I have tried to be very patient and understanding.  Although my attempts to resolve this were initially responded to promptly, my call to the office today to find out why the amount has still not been credited were not returned. Right now I am out over $130 due to their compounded error. 

This is not the first time: last year they owed me money for an over-payment I made due to their failure to estimate the insurance correctly and I waited months to get a refund.  They kept telling me the ""check was in the mail"" and it was not until I went to the office in person and demanded the money that they finally generated a check. 

I am a former dental office manager and I paid dental claims for an insurance company.  I know what I am talking about and I can understand how insurance works, but I can't get past the fact that I am being treated like a not-quite-bright three year old. 

I will likely continue to go to Champagne because the dentists are really very good and the technology they use is top of the line. However,from now on  I will NOT pay a dime for any services until after my insurance pays because these people either are being lied to by the insurance company or if they just cannot be trusted.

Six of us set out in the cold to enjoy some good food and a stiff drink after a wintery workweek.  Everyone commented on the fact that it was a cozy place. Some were surprised at the fact that it felt like a tree house or porch, which I bet is nice in the Spring. There were plastic covers on the sides so that the cold weather stayed out. Waiters were bumping into me though because the tables were placed too close together. Our waiter was acceptable. He mixed a few things up and only filled our waters once after we had to ask. But, he was there if we needed him.

With a small bar, they have a few specialty cocktails and what looked like a nice wine list. My St. Germain Gin and Tonic was excellent. 

We all ordered the cheese board to share which I highly recommend because it was large with fruit, bread and five different cheeses. Tasting the cheeses was fun because everyone got to comment on which they preferred. 

There was a staple menu which is what you'll find online and then specials that must vary. Many of us got the filet. I was slightly disappointed with the portion of potatoes and thought the filet was too tender. That may sound weird, but I am used to a steak tasting like a steak and the tenderness reminded me of prime rib. 

I much preferred the Mahi Mahi with red curry and vegetables. Again the portion of vegetables was lacking with like two slices of zucchini and a sliver of red bell pepper, but it was the best grilled zucchini that I've ever tasted.

The atmosphere is chill, and the decor sleek and modern. Mostly there are two top small tables, with a fun round table in the back with low seats that are perfect for children. The walls are adorned with great artwork that compliment the decor. 

Coffee-wise the cafe uses Reanimator coffee beans, a local Philadelphia roastery that produces some of the best beans around. The shop has a full espresso machine, and hired an experienced barista away from another local cafe, so the coffee hits the ground running. They offer a full compliment of drip, espresso and cappuccino drinks, and have almond and oat milk alternatives for those who are foregoing moo juice. 

The menu is a split between east and west. The West side includes standard fare like breakfast sandwiches, avocado toast, as well as soups and salads. The east has equivalents but with flavors reflecting Thai and Vietnamese influence. 

One special thing to note is the cafe features Nord bread, a local baker that uses sourdough starter and ancient grains to produce some of the most unctuous bread imaginable.  

Service here is impeccable, which is a credit to a place that hit the ground running the minute they opened the doors. Wifi is available, and the password is readily displayed at the counter.

793,657855651a6d2c7052a63d1e,"After coming here for a Titans game and a couple of concerts, I can say, without a doubt, that I'm a fan. Despite what name you call it, Nissan Stadium is an imposing figure that adds a lot to the sightlines of the city. Plus, how awesome is it to have the stadium (and Bridgestone, for that matter) actually *in* the city, rather than in some random semi-adjacent suburb? It's a small thing but it's a small thing a lot of other cities can't say. #dontevermove

The good looks aren't just there to be admired from afar. The actual stadium campus is Instragram-worthy, as well. If you have some time, walk around the stadium and check out the green space, art installations, gigantic Titans (fitting), and all sorts of other touches that make the stadium a city touchpoint and not just an means to an end. Once you've taken some time to admire the outside, go inside and take a seat. I've been on the club level, on the field and in a suite/box and all three experiences were special. The engineers did a fantastic job of assuring that all patrons are able to see what's going on. The stadium isn't just for the benefit of the connected and those who paid a lot of money for seats. Everyone is welcome to enjoy the action. If your eyes aren't as strong as they used to be, stop looking at the field and look up to the jumbotrons. Those bad boys are larger than a lot of buildings and offer HD enjoyment when you just want to sit back and take it all in. You can also sit back, close your eyes and listen, thanks be to Queen Bey. The sound system is now fit for music royalty.*

Assuming that you're at the stadium and have no interest in who's playing (instruments or sports), you'll need to get an eat/drink on. You can do that well. From Papa John's to Bojangles to pulled pork tater tots (the obvious winner), your belly will be fatter but you won't care. Your thirst will be quenched, as well. From the ballpark standards of Bud and its ilk, to Jack Daniels malt deliciousness to craft beer, to name brand spirits to frozen Bud-o-rita margaritas, there's no way you won't be able to sip something to keep the party going or to numb the pain.

Nissan isn't the small city that is Bridgestone but it's still an iconic member of the Nashville family. The city is stronger for its being here. If you haven't been, find a way to fix that -- even if it's just to take a walk around the building.

We definitely weren't expecting to take home delicious Chicken Korma & Samosos. Both were very good! I asked for very mild & got it. The accompanying white rice & naan was very good as well. 

The staff member was extremely friendly-- definitely not shy. He explained that they offer four prepared hot soups & two (or more?) prepared entrees available for anyone who stops in & wants to grab & go. There's also a warming display of Samosos and other pastries. 

Patrons can select from the prepared foods, order off the menu, eat in (I noticed two bright red plastic booths), pick up, or arrange for catering. There's an annoying fee for using debit or credit (ours was $.67). I'm not one to sit & eat within a brightly lit convenience store, but this establishment is a great one for takeout. Definitely NOT a restaurant for a date or a special occasion. (The outside & inside of the convenience store is far from upscale.)

Although the restaurant is centered around their Waygu beef in all varieties and preparations (even in the form of sushi), they have options for vegans!

Long wait? Always. 
Out of the way? From most places, yes. 
But WORTH IT.

This is another one of those Nashville staples that I had never tried until recently.  I always had some reason to talk myself out of going, but no more. 

Even on a week day around brunch we had a 45 minute wait, and that was even after calling ahead 45 minutes earlier. Granted, it was the week after Christmas, so I'm sure lots of people were off work and tourism was at a seasonal high. 

TIP: CALL AHEAD. You can't make a reservation, but you can go ahead and get your name on the list before you get there to cut your wait time. 

There are several cute little shops to keep you busy while you wait, but don't except to buy much unless you want overpriced souvenir trinkets.  It's the kind of stuff that's fun to browse, but that's about it.  One exception: You will be purchasing preserves to take home after you've tried them. Trust me. The blackberry preserves will change your life.

Now the food... As you've no doubt heard, the biscuits are amazing.  How amazing can a biscuit be, you may ask? Pretty damn amazing.  Slather them with a healthy load of butter and the above-mentioned blackberry preserves and that could be a meal in and of itself. 
Since it's not socially acceptable to eat an entire meal of free biscuits (which will keep coming until you say the word), your plate will likely be piled with various meats and other artery clogging deliciousness.  I had some sort of breakfast platter with eggs and lots of tasty meat... The exact contents of my meal is a little fuzzy due in part to the food coma I was left in and in part to the moonshine.  Yes, I said moonshine. 

Moonshine is a relatively new feature at Loveless. We were told it's typically served in small souvenir mason jars, but they were out of those, so we got regular sized ordinary mason jars, which means we got drunk.  If this happens to you, the shops are also a good place to walk off your buzz before getting back in the car.  There were a number of moonshine cocktails to choose from, from bloody mary, to various juice mixers... I went with orange juice and it was delicious.  

I know this place gets hyped up a lot, but it does not disappoint.  Just remember to call ahead and be prepared to wait anyway.  As long as you aren't an impatient pants and don't mind making a morning/afternoon of the trip, it's definitely worth it.",helpful,1,0

Decent Thai food with some good items, and some fails.

Fried tofu to start with was marginal - it was very bland with almost no flavor, and didn't have the silky interior that I love. However, the Larb Gai appetizer, chicken mixed with chili powder, scallions, mint leaves, Thai herbs and lime juice served with sliced cabbage, was outstanding, with a fabulous, fresh flavor.

For my entrée I had the Amazing, which was anything but.  Served cool, with a cloying, sweet brown sauce on top, it was almost inedible.  I sent it back to be warmed up, but that just made it even worse. My boyfriend had their special fried rice which he liked, but they must have gotten their 'heat level' confused, because his ordered medium was extra fiery.

Service was just okay. They had two waiters in the restaurant, and while they were attentive at first, that dropped off as more tables arrived.  It's been ten or so years since I tried this place, and it will probably be that long before I go back.",helpful,1,0

The girls are all very nice but do very mediocre work. After every pedicure I'm pulling out the file as soon as I get home. After  waxing I'm at home tweezing and shaving missed spots. My nail polish has never lasted the trip home after getting the Ok to leave. Perhaps most importantly they remove far too large of strips when waxing, which not only hurts like a mother f**er, but leaves my skin even more tender and swollen than usual. I quit getting waxing done there after my first time,  when they raced through it,  missed tons of spots, left small blisters on my underarms from too hot of wax,  and double dipped. Then they charged me $25 more than the price we agreed upon at the start. 

The staff from the hair salon next door are often coming and taking breaks at the stations, gossiping quite loudly,  sharing some inappropriate stories at times. I'm far from a prude but I don't want to hear about how many guys tried to sleep with you on your vacation while I'm trying to relax in a massage chair. 

I've been coming here for 3 months, hoping each time for a sudden miraculous improvement in service,  but after my most recent visit I am officially giving up. I feel I've given them a very solid chance to earn my business,  but it's just not going to happen.",helpful,1,0

My friends shared to me that we all didn't enjoy the dish but when asked, they all told the waitress the dish was perfect.

The 3 rooms they cleaned were the kitchen, living room and bedroom, even though the kitchen and living room is one space and the whole apartment is half the square footage of the maximum they advertised they were willing to clean. No problem, count them as separate rooms, I never really expected anything beyond the bare minimum anyway. So I leave them there for an hour. When I come back: a candleholder which I LOVED is BROKEN!!! All the idiot had to say is ""yea it shattered""... um, really, ok like that wasn't obvious. Not even ""I'm sorry"" or ""we'll give you a refund or perform an extra service"" or anything. What made it worse is that the candleholder was worth more money than the extra charge of $15 they charged to clean extra rooms beyond the 3, and they didn't even go ahead to throw in the bathroom or laundry room, to try to make up for the fact that they shattered my favorite piece in the whole living room, which I will never be able to find again, and for which they technically owe me. So they proceed to leave. No tip, obviously, they should have given me the price of my candleholder. I try to get over it, when I notice that THE ENTERTAINMENT CENTER IS COVERED IN DUST and they did not dust a chest that was sitting under the window, both in the living room, which was part of the 3 rooms they agreed to clean. Dusting was not on the long list of things they informed me were not included in the deal (the smallprint: a list of things which I received in an email AFTER I payed for the deal). This makes me SO ANGRY at this PATHETIC service and given that they caused more damage than they helped, I wish I never payed for this ridiculous scam.

883,657855651a6d2c7052a63fbb,"No trip to New Orleans is complete or makes sense for that matter without going to the French Quarter. This part of the city is the heart,soul, and everything that is the Big Easy. Unlike all the stuffy locals, I still to this day love going to the French quarter. Who doesn't love going to the hole in the wall dive bars or seedy strip clubs. I even enjoy checking out all the Restaurants. Besides the aforementioned businesses this area has lots of other things like Antique stores, clothing shops, museums, book stores, candy shops, and many others.

No matter how many times I have been down here I always manage to see something that I have never seen before. Here is an example, a few years ago I saw a couple in front of St. Louis Cathedral getting married on Halloween day. It just so happened that Halloween was on a Sunday. The groom was dressed up like Beetlejuice, the bride was dressed up like Lydia. The brides maids were dressed in black and so was the minister performing the ceremonies. To be honest it was a very interesting sight. But that story was just one of the many interesting things I witnessed here in the french quarter.

I also forgot to mention the swanky upscale hotels, the casinos, and the many tours operating out of here. But I personally rarely ever go to these type of venues. I guess they really don't excite me enough. But I do hit up  the french market though. They always got an assortment of goodies for sale.

All in all there is something for everyone in this part of the city. If you can come to this part of the city and you are still bored/miserable. Then you will probably be like that where ever you go. Because if you are bored in this part of the city then it is your own fault. 

One more word of caution to everyone out their. The french quarter is a very adult themed place. If you have kids and you don't want them exposed to that kind of atmosphere then by all means take them to Disneyworld!",helpful,1,0

If you value a good night of sleep, this place should be absolutely avoided for three major reasons: 1) It's located close to a number of hospitals so expect ambulance sirens and helicopter rotor noises at any possible hour of the day. 2) It has ridiculously ""sensitive"" fire-alarms that go off frequently, tens of times a week, and often very early in the mornings. Not a good combination with the heat in the summer or the bitter cold in the winter of Philadelphia. 3) There're more than a few inconsiderate residents who enjoy thumping the basses at headache-inducing levels as late as 3:00am. Those being said, the biggest crock is the ""fee happy"" management. Their practice is best described as a racket. Right off the bat, they charge an exorbitant $135 ""application"" fee. Then there's their practice of frequently claiming non-receipt or under-payment of rent despite only their office staff having access to that rent dropbox. They have a long long list of ""fees"" to extract ""fines"" out of tenants, such as $75 for maintenance to unclog a sink. Their management staff wait literally until the very last minute before office closing to disable tenants' internet access, for any alleged claims of late rent payments, leaving tenants without recourse to restoring internet access during a long holiday weekend.

This review is past due but much deserved to Adam and the crew at Livery for impeccable service, WONDERFUL food, and FANTASTIC tequila and mescal drinks.

Adam knows the menu!  Trust him.  He'll take care of you and pamper your whole group like your family (family he likes, that is!).  He even gave a tiny sample of dolce de leche sauce to go because I felt in love with it.  I took it back to my hotel and rubbed it on my naked body -- it was THAT good.  

Try sitting up on the patio outside upstairs.  Nice weather and an arts-district soho noho vibe.  

Beautiful decor.

Extensive menu but I'll highlight several things...

You must try the cauliflower starter.  Oh my!  A total hit with the table.  And the cheese empanadas were divine!  

For entrees --
My colleagues and I also loved the Mahi mahi tacos and skirt steak but by far the winner for dinner entrees was the Portobello Tostada.  I am noooooo where near a vegetarian, but this thing was BURSTing with flavor and a hit with everyone.

For dessert--
Get the same platter.
Beautiful chocolate flan.
Yummy tres leches cake.
And for 4 women from So Cal --- unanimous vote for best churros ever!  It was a surprise to all of us.  The dulce de leche sauce was lick-the-plate fantastic!

The wine list was nice. A little bit of everything from every region both whites and reds. However, we had the waiter open the bottle we'd brought from our own collection, as there wasn't anything comparable on the list for less than $60 - 80.

To start we had the cheddar fritters, and they were great. Really, really good. This concludes the end of the good things about Yellow Porch.

For entrees my wife and I had the paella and pork chop, respectively. The paella reminded me very much of rice and tomatoes that my mom used to make when I was growing up, but not in a good way...in the ""we mixed a can of tomatoes and some water with rice and put it on a plate"" sort of way. The shrimp were terribly-overcooked pieces of fishy-tasting rubber. The mussels were inedible. Tasted very much like dirt. Literally.

The pork chop was a nice, thick-cut loin. However, it was prepared in a very sticky, overly-sweet bath of marinade, which completely covered the taste of the meat. Comparable to something you'd find on the $7.99 TGIFriday's special menu. The Hoppin' John that came with was great. Really good.

We skipped dessert, obviously.

On the service: After pouring our first glasses of wine, the waiter returned only once to take our entree orders. Someone else delivered our water refills. At one point the waiter acknowledged my wife while she was preparing to refill her own wine glass, and he never offered to help. He did not bring the pre-meal bread that all of the surrounding tables received promptly. He also did not acknowledge my wife's picked over paella (all mussels remaining and a half-eaten shrimp on the side) except to say, ""You must want a box for this.""

My husband talked me into ordering Uber Eats from here after he left the chicken on the grill and fell asleep (forty minutes later I woke him up asking where the chicken was...it was completely burnt). 

The only reason I agreed was the lettuce wraps. I really like their lettuce wraps (to be fair, I've never met a chicken lettuce wrap that I haven't liked). As all my prior experiences, I loved the lettuce wrap appetizer and it would have been the perfect meal. Unfortunately, we got more dishes.

The Mongolian Beef was delicious, like always. We got it with fried rice instead of white rice and I thought it was just ok. My husband said he liked the fried rice. 

The beef lo mein was just meh. I liked the beef, but I found the dish overall to be mediocre. However, my son loves noodles to I'd be open to getting it again for him.

The orange chicken is what went downhill for me. I really didn't like it. It had an overpoweringly sweet taste. Also, traveling from Clearwater to Westchase did not bode well for a fried dish (can't blame P.F. Chang's for that though). Usually I love any breaded and fried chicken from a Chinese restaurant so this was a major disappointment to me.

Since moving to the Tampa/St Pete area from Chicago (the steakhouse capital of America) a year ago, I have constantly heard from friends and neighbors - ""you have to go to Berns"".  So, for my birthday, my girlfriend and I went.  

It's good, not great.  The experience is over-rated.  Yes, we did the tour.  Yes, we did the dessert room.  However good these experiences are, the black mark goes to the server (a position which should make the overall experience go from good to great).  

First bad mark:  To Mark, our server, I expressed clearly my dislike for onions.  The salad was good.  The lobster bisque was salty, but good.  Both sans onions.  However, why did you neglect to suggest a substitute for the onion rings that accompanied my NY Strip (which was good).  Even alerting me to this would have been appreciated.

Second bad mark for Mark:  You included 12.5% service fee (tip) on our $450 tab (which included a $250 bottle of red).  Why didn't you mention this as you placed the tab on our table?  Guessing you were hopeful we wouldn't notice the $50 tip already added in.  I nearly left an add'l $100 tip on the $500 total tab.  Instead, you got your 12.5%.  More than you earned.  A good waiter would have told us that a 12.5% tip is already added in and if we feel the service was exceptional, we can/should add more.  

Be honest, Berns is overrated.  It may have been a legendary experience years ago, but my first (and only) experience was average.  The food was good.  The wine was great.  The service was poor.  Tampa/St Pete - you can do better.",helpful,1,0

My wife and I were commenting to each other saying things like ""That's such a good idea"" and ""I never would've thought of that"" throughout the entirety of the day. We were so excited to see the final product of those ideas, knowing they were going to be exceptional, and now that we have the photos we can say for certain that Kate and John blew our expectations out of the water.

Service is great and the waitress was very knowledgeable and knew her menu.

We started with the Okonomi fries.  Their waffle fries are so darn good!  Perfectly fried and taste delicious.  I could've done without the Okonomi.  The waitress did warn us it was fishy and we ordered either way, although I wish she would've clarified and said salmon shavings.  Not that big of an issue and we ate it all.

We ordered Le Big Matt at the waitress' recommendation and the Marn Blanc and added sausage.

We made a reservation for 1030 am, and it was a mess. People milling around, staff seemed confused? (Is brunch new for them?)  Service left a LOT to be desired - it was at least 15 minutes until somebody came to give us water, and I had to flag a person down. All three of us had already gone and done a full round at the buffet in shifts. We were there to BRUNCH, with drinks included! Once we got our waiter to the table (~20 minutes in), he was very nice, but it was clear they were uber disorganized.

We made a reservation ahead of time, but I doubt it's necessary. There were tons of empty tables up until about 1230 when we left on a Saturday. We sat in the garden/atrium all the way at the front.. you really miss out on the ambiance sitting up there, but it was a quieter and I was with friends I haven't seen in a while, so it worked out well as far as catching up. I recommend requesting the inside for a livelier feel, if that's your thing.

The drinks are exquisite. I had the drink calle dsomething ""bloom"", which was served beautifully with a single flower floating on the top. It was potent, made to perfection, and when it finally got to me, I was super happy. All of the cocktails my friends and I sampled were BOMB.

That said, the food was AMAZING. Buffets can easily be underwhelming, where quantity takes precedence over quality, but that was not the case here. The prime rib was AWESOME, there's an omelette station, plenty of well-made treats (try the key lime bites, so good!). The cheese were on point and there was a good variety, and old favorites - e.g. bagel/cream cheese/yogurt/granola/donuts - are also on hand. The quiche, which is also a tough thing to do well, was divine - a spinach/mushroom/cheese variety. The food is what saved this experience for me, because I didn't enjoy a lot of the rest of it.

You take it to a reputable mechanic and get them to give it a thorough inspection! That's exactly where my relationship with Skip Thompson began 3 years ago, and ever since he's been servicing all of my vehicles. When it came to the van, knowing we were headed to no mans land in the desert, Skip was sure to do a top to bottom review of absolutely every vital piece of the vehicle. About 24 hours later he called me with a full report, including which things I needed to address immediately and which could easily wait. Skip performed the necessary stuff and thanks to his great work, our van Bertha, as we affectionately refer to her, has made not one, but three safe trips to the playa!  

On another occasion a belt randomly came flying off my Mazda when starting it up in a parking lot. Because I know nothing about cars I thought I could just put the belt back on, but when I realized that wasn't the case, I made an emergency call to Skip! I had the car towed to him, and 24 hours later I had a diagnosis and solution, and less than 24 hours later the car was fixed and back in my driveway! 

When I recently decided to pickup a 99 Chevy Pickup, Skip was the first person I called. He was happy to perform another top to bottom inspection for me, which revealed that this old truck had been well cared for, and nothing needed to be done. Regardless, when something does happen, I know exactly where I'll be taking it. 

Skip already did it all from his mobile shop, but I'm happy that he purchased this longstanding business, and has moved his already amazing operation into a full service shop.

Down there, pointing is the universal language, and price is relayed with raised fingers. There's always a moment of uncertainty after consumption - what did I just eat, will this meal be my last? Those memories are the best, and the hardest to replicate. Not impossible, though.

I'm told the Taco Bus was once mobile. Increased demand combined with swelling gas prices rendered the bus sedentary, and a building grew around it. Now it resembles its ramshackle counterparts south of the border - wooden tables hammered together under electric fans blowing hot, wet air just fast enough to keep the flies off.

945,657855641a6d2c7052a63472,"If you're from Indy, there's a pretty good chance you've heard of Greiner's Sub Shop.

There's a pretty good chance you're aware of the Greiner's Food Truck. 

If you are familiar with Indy's food trucks, you've likely paid a visit to that delightful pink truck called Scout's (Yum!). 

If you're a dog lover, then you also likely have heard of BARK Truck. 

What you may not know? All of these beloved Indy entities are woven into the same culinary fabric thanks to connections made, not quite perfect relationships, corporate exits and bigger dreams. 

All of these things find a presence inside Greiner's, a quirky little shop that has found a home in Nora in the shopping center across from North Central High School. While my first thought was that this seemed llike an odd location for a sandwich shop, the truth is that there's so much personality and charm to this location that my mind was changed by the end of my first visit. 

While most folks who are familiar with Greiner's fondly remember Ray Greiner's Shelby Street location, this revival of Greiner's comes courtesy of Lisa Moyer, a former corporate world presence who left that world and started Scout's Treat's followed by BARK Truck. As the Greiner's menu explains, it was cupcake girl's meeting of a not so perfect prince on match.com that led her into the world of delis and then, alas, her purchase of Greiner's. Reportedly, Lisa has named one of the subs after the not so perfect prince - I'm just hoping it's not the Fat Head or Mr. Turkey. 

Then, finally, she answered the call to find a Northside location and this newer but just as lovable Greiner's opened up serving a wide variety of hot/cold subs, salads, mac n' cheese, soups, pizzas, wings, etc. Additionally, they have a wide variety of drinks and even some freakalishus coffees. Oh, and directly next door you even have a small space that serves as a delightfully delicious dog deli. In case you're wondering if they actually like dogs, the entrance into the dog deli of a 'dorable dachshund caused at least one employee to start cooing as if she'd just given birth. 

I ordered a 7"" Italian Sausage pizza with fennel sausage, provolone and mozzarella cheese and my usual unsweetened iced tea. The meal came in at just over a ten spot and easily satisfied me. They do have some breadstick options, seemingly a bit pricey to me, but also a wide variety of other options including plain ole' bags of chips. They do also serve beer on tap and wine in-house. 

The shop itself is smallish, though even in a wheelchair I had little trouble maneuvering around. The decor is somewhat kitschy, sort of an industrial meets hipster home meets ""I like this. I'll put it on the wall."" Personally? I enjoyed it quite a bit. There are games on most tables, a clear sign that they're not aiming to rush you out the doors. 

Parking for wheelchairs can be found at each end of the small retail center, though there are curb cuts in other spots. There are two entrances, one street side and one court side. You order closest to the street side entrance (which faces 86th Street). There is signage indicating how to order, though it's smallish and they were pretty casual about it all. 

The pizza was quite good, though I'm not sure I'll go for it next time. It was a tad messy for my slightly spastic hands and the crust didn't really lend itself to my not so fine motor skills. Since I was pretty sure they didn't want to participate in the feeding of their customers, though they were amazingly friendly, I kept napkins nearby and survived without a single shirt stain!

If there's a selling point here, I must admit it's the people. This place is super friendly and they seem to clearly enjoy working with one another. While some prefer a more efficient ""just get me through the line,"" this is the kind of environment I really like. The drinks are self-serve, though they were quick to offer help if needed. When one employee saw that I had sort of straddled the end of a table, she was quick to offer to move a chair. They just sort of went above and beyond again and again. 

I really like this place - It reminds me of Yelp's beloved Britt, a quirky and warm spirit followed by good service and a quality effort. They serve up good food and you could tell by conversations that the neighborhood was becoming aware of them. 

I'm not quite ready to fork over that 5th star, but in a sea of generic, corporate owned sandwich shops it's refreshing to see this locally owned shop develop such a strong identity and offer such a diverse menu with service that actually feels local. This location, as well, opens at 6am because of their extended coffee menu and breakfast options. 

I wouldn't be surprised if that 5th star shows up in the very near future. It's no wonder that Ray Greiner himself has shown up on Facebook praising Lisa's efforts as this updated Greiner's maintains everything we loved about Ray's place and adds healthy doses of humor, heart, and good food.",helpful,1,0

To my delight, there were probably at least 10 beers I haven't ever tried, so we sampled a few of those and split some appetizers.  The ""hoppy"" wings were smokey and delicious but the homemade bleu cheese really took it up a notch.  We also had the Mediterranean plate, chicken and duck tacos, and the curry shrimp over a mussel salad.  The best of the three was the shrimp, however, the Medi plate is a great sharing dish.

954,657855651a6d2c7052a6465d,"Had a taste for crabs today but didn't feel like driving down to Maryland or the shore due to unpredictable traffic on this holiday weekend. So, decided to scout out a place in a nearby city and based on many of the reviews decided to give this place a try.

Upon entering, I noticed that most of the tables were full in this dimly lit, dated and whimsical crab themed decor eatery.  The second thing I noticed as we stood and waited for more than a couple of minutes, was the wait staff appeared impersonal and disengaged. But brushed it off as they were busy.

The menu had an overwhelming amount of choices from crabs, shrimp, scallops, clams, soups/bisques, fried to steamed selections. Prices for meals and platters were reasonable but I was a little thrown off by the crabs being individually priced versus by the 1/2 dozen, dozen or bushel as I am used to.                                         

For locals this might be a suitable seafood joint however, if one has had an array of experiences dining at non-chain/commercial seafood shacks, this place lacks a certain quality and dining experience.

The customer service from the waitress was quite bad. She took the order and never came back by the table to see if we needed anything, nor did she bring all the food items that were ordered but yet it was on the bill. To their cedit, they did remove the item from the bill once alerted. The crabs were fair-good and the crab cake was a little over fried with a lot of filler. Thank goodness the fries were tasty. The ambiance and the general appearance of the restaurant dampened the overall experience. It's almost as though one was invited to dinner in someone's basement and they forgot you were even there. It's like since the owners have been in business since the 70s it's allowed itself to let mediocrity to be acceptable. Especially since it has a steady clientele.

963,657855641a6d2c7052a63416,"I had it all planned out to visit Heartbreaker and Landlocked Baking Company, one of three sister businesses (Strangebird being the other) in the small Irvington strip center that formerly housed The Mug and Tyner Pond Farm Market. Unfortunately, as I arrived I quickly found out that Heartbreaker isn't opening up until 4pm these days - so, I dejectedly headed next door to check out Landlocked. 

As was previously true, this building is fairly wheelchair friendly. They've tried to adapt to the pandemic by renting out PODS to allow people to dine safely outside (I think this is primarily Strangebird). It takes up 1/2 the parking lot. However, there are two accessible parking spots and a curb cut directly in front of Heartbreaker. Landlock has a two-sided glass door that's a little heavy but not bad. You go in, masks are required and social distancing enforced, and there's a counter to your right and a handful of booths to the left along with a sort of sofa/table in the middle. Heartbreaker also has tables in front of it outside similar to those that were at The Mug. 

They have a small printed out menu, there's a photo of it in the photos. Essentially, they are known for their pastries, coffee, hot drinks, and a handful of cold drinks. They also have some breakfast sandwich type options. It's a relatively small menu. I'd read multiple raves about the chocolate croissant and got some hot chocolate to go with it. 

The decor inside is like a cousin to Strangebird, sort of a tiki-lite with an emphasis on casual comfort. There's a single user restroom that looked accessible. Interestingly enough, they don't really have any tables that are accessible - all the tables are taller except for one - the sofa/coffee table arrangement. That table is rather low and designed for lounging with the sofa. I have a feeling this layout is their pandemic layout. 

The employees were friendly. They offer a rewards club if you enter your phone number. Today, they were noted as only accepting credit cards. I have no idea if this is a regular deal. 

As I recall, the chocolate croissant was around $3-3.50 I think. The hot chocolate was priced at $4.50, which strikes me as absurd since you're getting about 12 ounces. My total bill was a bit over $8, which strikes me as pricing for the neighborhood. 

The chocolate croissant was definitely a delight, though possibly would have been better heated up. It was bagged up. I took the croissant and hot chocolate and sat at one of Heartbreaker's outside tables. The hot chocolate, as you can probably tell from my tone, was definitely not worth $4.50 and I would not order it again. 

Overall, this was a solid experience and a great opportunity to support an up-and-coming Indy business. They emphasize their pastries and their pastries were top-notch. Business was steady, but people were being respectful of space and each other. I even had a customer open the door for me since I was carrying hot chocolate. I've always liked the Irvington area. 

I can easily go 4-stars, but with the overpriced hot chocolate and lack of a wheelchair option for tables I'm not able to go up to a 5-star. That said, I'd easily return and will return the next time I'm in Irvington. Hopefully, it'll be a time when I can also check out Heartbreaker.",helpful,1,0

We placed orders fairly quickly and while we expected to wait on a busy Sunday morning, the hour plus for food surprised us some. Many of our dishes were lukewarm or melting upon receiving them. What was really surprising was the final person in our group never getting his food. 3 people were alerted and for over 20 minutes none of them came back with food or checked on us. When someone finally dropped in and we reminded them about the missing dish, there were no apologies. The food was dropped off with little acknowledgment and we had to request drink refills since it had now been more than 30 minutes since anyone had looked our way. 

At some point they must have realized that it bringing food or drinks might make a bad impression so we got double refills and a comped dish but with the 20% mandatory gratuity it was clear they weren't that bothered. The goodbyes at the end of the meal included requests that we give them another chance.

Okay, here's the juice: the wine is good. It's dependent on your selection. Choose wisely or you'll end up with blah choices (again, depending on your taste). You'll have the option of 2, 4, or 6 oz pours. 

How this worked for us:
1. Ask the person working to explain the process; wait for a look of confusion because you should know this as the patron. 
2. Don't tell them you've been to bars like this before because the rules at this one may be different. 
3. You give them money, they give you a card, then you go get wine. It's that simple. 
4. Not efficient use of the fancy machines. I would recommend taking a page out of W.I.N.O New Orleans' book and issue the cards, have the patrons get as much wine as they want, then pay before the depart. Since I had to prepay for my card, I will stop drinking once my money is spent. I came to drink, not spend time trying to recharge my card. This isn't Dave and busters, this is Tastings.

We arrived for dinner on a Sunday and the line started to form an hour prior to opening. The line is ridiculous. Cashiers can't keep up. Get in line early if time is an issue.

To start off, we were given four alcoholic drink vouchers. These vouchers were labeled without restrictions, but in the end we were told it was limited to beers on tap. That's a plus regardless. 

Don't expect an abundance of seafood, but adequate enough. Dungeness Crab legs drenched in oyster sauce is probably the best option you would get.

My reason for the stay this time around is the last reason.  Kind of annoys me how there are plenty of resorts to pick from basket and I know they are not full, yet they charge $90+ for one night stay.  Obviously I picked this place because it was the cheapest I can find for the price I was willing to pay.  

I picked this location as it was somewhat away from the main commotion.  They have a small structure to park and an elevator to connect you to the hotel lobby.  For the size of the resort, the lot is quite small.  The standard bed was enough to sleep on.  The bathroom had no vents that I could hear of--so bring a match for a quick deodorizing scent.  

One thing to note is if you are a light sleeper, don't come here.  The walls are thin that I could hear ruckus throughout the night; however, I was exhausted from a day of boarding that it didn't bother me as much as it should if i wasn't so tired.

-outdoor pool - who is exactly going to use it when it its frigidly cold in the winter?

As I wouldn't call myself a beer guy, having a new brewery in town was neat but nothing over the top.  During their early days, I would grab a drink with friends then head on to other eateries.  Once they established their menu, that changed.  While they have a few menu items locked in, they rotate quite a few based on seasonal availability.  I love this rotation since it means I nearly always have something new to try.  As luck would have it, my favorite, the Schnitzel, is a menu main stay so I also have a fall back option.

Their happy hour is a solid deal as well.  I believe it runs until 6pm and offers $1 off beers, usually has a specialty cocktail you can enjoy if you aren't into beer, and also includes a new small bite every week.  Their happy hour also features a smaller version of their burger (in regular and vegan form) if you aren't too hungry or want to test them out before a larger commitment.

I'll round off the review the way I started it: the staff and service.

While it's out of our neck of the woods and a good eight miles from home, we still wanted to go some place different for my boyfriends birthday and to watch his favorite baseball team.  

When we pulled into the parking lot it was a little sketchy, I'm not gonna lie.  There were a few guys outside smoking and they looked like regulars.  We walked by them as they stared at us awkwardly and we proceeded through the odd looking front door.

The inside is very open and very large and it was also very loud.  There was a group of young adults most likely celebrating something.  The huge square bar had many vacant seats, aside from the loud group of six or so.  We picked a couple of seats to the side and asked for the Cubs game to be turned on one of their many television screens.  The bartender introduced herself as Tracy and she was very informative about the menu and the current beers on tap. 

My mind was still deciding on what to drink and the bartenders didn't hesitate to keep asking for my order.  I finally asked for a whiskey and coke with a cherry and received it immediately.  However, they don't have any cherries here.  We also ordered up some teriyaki chicken wings and they were okay.  To me, they seemed old and freezer burned then thrown into the fryer, but my boyfriend thought there was an ample amount of meat on them.  They were served with baby carrots, celery, and a plastic cup of ranch with a lid, which I did not eat.  

When my boyfriends mom showed up to watch the game with us she felt like drinking a cocktail and asked for a Moscow mule.  Tracy told us they didn't have ginger ale or mint at this bar.  Mostly, Blitz's is good for beer, shots, booze, and simple food.  She decided on a Blue Moon and the chips & salsa.  I will say the chips were very good, they were served warm and the salsa was extremely tasty.  I'm a huge salsa connoisseur and I felt I could drink this salsa.  It had just the right amount of heat and texture.  There were so many chips in the basket after the salsa was gone so for only 50 cents we had to order a side of nacho cheese sauce.  This made everyone happy.  

Everything was a good deal because our total bill at the end of the night was only $17.  Of course, we were playing a little bit of video poker and keno and most of our drinks were comped.  My boyfriend accidentally left his birthday present from his mom on the bar and he realized when we got home.  He quickly called Tracy to see if she could keep it there and that he's be in the next day to pick it up.  FYI: Blitz's is closed on Sunday's, so he picked it up on his lunch break on Monday and they had it waiting for him.

Over the past year or so, I have been able to keep it under control using spironolactone (perscribed by a dermatologist) which regulates the hormones in my body but it still wasn't keeping my face 100% clear.  I was referred to Dr. Finley for an acne facial last month and it was great.  Amy did an amazing job and extracted a lot of trapped oil in my lower face.  It left my skin so soft and I saw the difference it made over the following weeks.  Dr. Finley also suggested I start using the Jan Marini Oily Skin care line.  I LOVE IT!  I've tried so many face washes/lotions and this tops them all.  It leaves my face feeling fresh and taut without EVER drying my skin out.  It truly has made a difference in clearing up anything small that would pop up occasionally.  I highly recommend it for anyone working to achieve an improved complexion.

 Anyone who grew up in Deleware County knows this place, and has probly been painfully pecked by a chicken here. You get alot of bang for your buck @ Lynn- ville. Admission is free and you can pet and feed all the animals there , from chickens to emus. 
 They have a playground with really cool sets, not just the usual swings and slides (for example , wooden pirate ships, tractor trailers,castles, etc.) Its free but they have a honor box where you can do $1 per kid (or nothing at all cheapskate!). This playground also includes a little barn where you can jump in the hay and the most devious fence maze ive ever experienced. No matter how many times I go I wind up getting lost in there as my kids burn though it  and laugh at me.
 From spring to fall, they usually have something going on each weekend. Always very family oriented. I agree that on weekends it can be a madhouse so go on a weekday for your first time. Food is really good but it loses a star because i recently found out that the pies they make are not made on premesis anymore (theyre still better than supermarket pies.
 This place is so hot that back in the late 90s, it actually burned to the ground! (that may not be the real reason). All Delco gasped at their landmark being gone but in only a few years it rose like a pheonix from the ashes and is actually better than ever.

What award did your wings win? Its touted on the menu as ""Award Winning Buffalo Wings,""but theres nothing award winning about them. Wings were coated in a THICK batter that soaks up all the grease it's fried in. It is for this fact that wings shouldn't be battered.

1040,657855641a6d2c7052a6343f,"Absolutely loved my stay at the Hyatt House for a girls' weekend in NOLA. From the beginning of our stay at check-in, the staff was so welcoming and friendly. They truly went above and beyond and even upgraded our room to one on the top floor. Anghelique was a true gem and helped us out multiple times during our stay.

The hotel is set up a little differently than most, in that, you have to take an elevator immediately up to another level to check-in (floor 11). The check-in area is a brightly-colored, modern space that also provides complimentary fruit-infused water. On the same floor is also the breakfast area which is quite spacious.

Once we got to our room, we had a prime view of the superdome and pool area. Our room had two Queen sized beds with a large TV, desk, and a little seating nook. The bathroom had a large glass enclosed shower. 

The breakfast area and daily spread was a delightful surprise. The hotel provides free breakfast so I was expecting the typical sad array of bagels, muffins, and oatmeal. Hyatt House truly outperformed day after day with their breakfast. First of all, everything is laid out in an aesthically-pleasing way. All of the juices are in glass pitchers, all-white plates and coffee mugs. These are details that I appreciate. There is a made-to-order omelet bar where you place your order via pencil and paper and leave it with the cooks. There's a cereal box display of your usual options, breakfast meats that vary consisting of bacon, link sausage, scrambled eggs (I wasn't fan of the scrambled eggs - too watery), pancakes, oatmeal and grits, bagels, bread, fruit. As well as coffee and tea options. I can't stress how much the spread impressed us daily. There's also a crew that help keeps the area clean and everything refilled.

As for location of the hotel, it's located near all of the hot spots. Ten minute walk to Bourbon St, Jackson Square. Five minute walk to Canal st. There's also a trolley stop about twenty feet from the hotel that will take you up and down Canal, to the Garden district, etc.

The parking situation is something that we, thankfully, didn't have to deal with. We relied on our legs and uber. I do know that there's no designated parking garage for the hotel and that a valet service is available, however, I did notice a night or two where they had a sign out stating valet wasn't available so I would imagine that could/would cause issues.

1044,657855641a6d2c7052a634e2,"Well I have to say I am not sure what gym some of these people are going too. But it is nothing like what I experienced. It is the worst fitness experience I have ever had. I have   been to many different places in Alberta.

Okay where to start? Some of the treadmill's are not working properly or at all. Often the tv/entertainment system's are not functioning. There was times that there was no cleaning towel's or solution present to use. When signing up for a membership they tell you ""this place has the best equipment money can buy,  as well it is being maintained"".

Next the bathrooms at time's were horrible. I have seen night clubs near the end of a Saturday night with cleaner facilities. There were times with no paper towels or toilet paper. Well if you want to count the stuff on the floor in the stalls. Oh yes I could I forget urine stains all over the seats. I guess some people have trouble hitting the bowl I guess. But where is the staff in cleaning that up????

But the disturbing thing was when all of the above problems were reported nothing was done. If the so called management was doing it's job they wouldn't exist in the first place. When informed of the issue's you got the feeling they could care less. There was a late sunday night where I worked out. I tried to report something to the clerk working and him and 5 of his friends were crowded a laptop watching something. So who knows what that was. But I guess more important than a customer.

Now when signing up for your membership it is constant pressure. The gym personnel is not really interested in having you read the agreement. Also not interested in explaining any of the terms to you. The agent was trying to rush you through and have you sign on the dotted line ASAP. In addition to these things he told me ""this deal is only available today"" this was untrue because they were running a promo at this time. The promo being advertised was better than the ""great deal"" that I received. When asking the management about getting the promo I was told no it is too late.

After a few month's with my work schedule and the poor service at the gym I decided to cancel. Well I tried to complete that. During the sign up I was obviously told things that were not true. There was no indications that after transferring the membership would take 30 days and during that time I would be responsible for the fee's. So they were still charging me and the person I transferred it too. When the billing is done in house how is that possible. The management is just so greasy and shady that there isn't enough space here to type everything out. I wonder where they find some of the staff there?? They basically make it as hard as possible for people to leave the gym.

Kidding. I was psyched to try out Tired Hands as it is a much buzzed about new place in my old haunt. I don't currently live that far away yet I rarely find myself in this area anymore. Just driving there was literally a trip down memory lane even though the landscape of Ardmore has changed drastically. 

From riding my bike to Ardmore West to eat from Roy Rogers "" Fixin's Bar"" ( now a McDonalds) and rushing into Kiddie City to covet the latest Star Wars figures and Atari 2600 games ( now a strip mall) to driving a police car through the area as a Lower Merion cop, this area holds a ton of lasting memories for me.

Since there's only street parking in front of TH, I parked only a block away in the big lot behind the Ardmore movie theater ...Er Philly Sports Club, which is free after 6pm. 
Hands is located towards the end of Ardmore ave at Lancaster, which was previously a section pretty much unmemorable to me as a youth, so I didn't feel any resentment towards the new place.

My initial impression of the space  is that it is very charming and rustic. They left the foundation pretty much as is and have focused more on the beer and food. It reminds me a lot of my favorite bars in the city Doobies and even more so, The Institute.

The staff was great and all seemed excited to be a part of something like this. I didn't spend a lot of time at the bar, but our female bartender upstairs was extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgable  about the beer and food options. 

I had come for the UYE thrown by McThrill and we ended up having to push a bunch of tables together due to the amazing turnout. Our server did about as good a job as he could do with such a large and constantly seat shifting group. 

All of what I just described is peripheral filler, because this is a place of food and spirits so its time to dish on the dishes. Previous to coming, the 2 things I heard is that the beer is fantastic ...but eat elsewhere. I found this statement to be a bit skewered. First, the beer. 

There's no doubt that its well made beer, it's just for my taste, I found it too hoppy. I prefer darker beers from Lager to Stout and Tired Hands seems to concentrate on Pale Ales, and IPAs. I am by no means saying they aren't good, for what they were they were wonderful, it's just not my preference. The bartender did mention that they sometimes make a porter so I'd be interested to come back and try that. 

When people say not to rely on the food at Tired Hands, it's not because it isn't good. Quite the opposite. I found their offerings to be fresh and tasty. I think what people mean is that it isn't a full menu of substantial meals. On this visit, our large group ordered just about 1 of everything on their menu and what i sampled really hit the spot for me.The  Bread made there  was awesome and this is coming from a baker. They also make their own pickles and have a candied maple bacon that amps flavor to 11. I thoroughly enjoyed the cheese and cured meats platters served with the above mentioned bread. 

Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone wholeheartedly and feel a combination of pride/big brotherness towards Tired Hands. I hope and expect it to do well. While it wouldn't make my 12year old bike rounds it certainly makes my 42 year old bar crawl rounds in the Ardmore area.",helpful,1,0

1057,657855651a6d2c7052a63b2e,"My experience at Breathe Spa left me disappointed. This is my second visit to the spa in as many weeks. My mother & I went to Breathe Spa to celebrate her birthday. 15 minutes into my first visit on Jan 22nd, I was asked to come to the front desk (in my robe) so the staff could inform me that there was a scheduling conflict; my masseuse wasn't put on the schedule for me. So I could either wait 90 minutes for them to arrive or I could reschedule for another day and be compensated with a 75 min. massage instead of just a 50 min one. I accepted their offer to come back on Feb 4th. Of course, this meant that I had to wait 60 mins for my mother to finish her massage. Upon my return on Feb 4th, I asked the front desk staff if they'd been notified of the increased massage time. After checking the system for a good minute, they finally noted the change. 

I'm escorted to the locker room where the staff member informs me that there are no lockers available currently, but I could go ahead and get undressed, as she was sure someone would be leaving shortly. And where should I put my large, heavy winter coat, clothes, jewelry, etc til then?? Thankfully, someone was prepping to leave before I got fully undressed, so that worked out. 

I go sit in the spa lounge area and, since there are no magazines or anything, I note the unused and twisted curtain anchors and the peeling wall paper. I'm greeted by my masseuse, who is very nice. I ask him if he's aware that my massage time was increased. He had no idea what I was talking about, and had to leave to confirm with the front desk staff. 

My massage didn't exactly go as planned. I think my masseuse used to be a mechanic or something, because he had the roughest, most calloused hands I've ever felt! He could've drawn blood & left my back looking like Kunta Kinte's if he'd have pressed a little harder. I block it out and I finally begin to relax and let my mind wander. A short time later he chimes 'HOT STONES!' right before he cauterized what was left of my back flesh. Hot stones, I found, is not my cup of tea. My neck rub was phenomenal, but i think he had a flashback of some kind; instead of gently pulling and extending my neck, he yanked it like he's trying to snap it - no exaggeration. He applied my mint foot scrub, then proceeds to rub, not only my soles, but rubs the flesh from the top of my feet! 

He then asks ""feel good?"". I whimper ""yes"". My feet are stinging now from the memory...

After my massage, I'd decided to use the steam bath, which was amazing and well-maintained. As I stepped out, I see a staff member has just finished cleaning up a shower stall, so I run to it to wash the oils off my skin. As I start to lather up, I note all the hairs from previous bathers sticking to the shower walls and on the bottle of shampoo. 'Ew! Didn't she just clean in here?!' I sigh, dry off and run to the locker room to dress. 

NOT a pleasant experience and I will NEVER return to this spa. To be fair, my mother thoroughly enjoyed her massage, but she also felt that her money would've been better spent elsewhere.",helpful,1,0

2. They don't offer the chorizo on their happy hour menu (possibly the whole menu, I couldn't find it on the regular menu, but also could be wrong)

Since the other tables were mostly in the front and we were in the back, I didn't get the same sense of attention as I did before. It seems like it was just our waitress because although it was busy, the table right next to us got the a waitress who was charismatic and super helpful. 

Secondly, we were being served water during our meal and I asked the hostess if she could please grab me a side of ketchup. She replied and said ""I'm just the hostess. Your waitress can come by and help you."" Our waitress came by and asked us what we needed. I told her ketchup and then she brought it to us. What I don't understand is that 1. Why couldn't the hostess help us with our small request? Maybe it's against the restaurant rules? 2. Why couldn't she just tell the waitress then what we needed so that we didn't have to wait for the waitress to come by and then wait for the ketchup? This is inefficient. 

Maybe the two people that were serving us were just having bad/busy days? I'm not sure. There was 1 more hostess and 2 other wait staff that seemed to be doing just fine. 

Food wise though, it was still good. Prices are still good. I just didn't have to wait to get halfway through our fries for a condiment.",unhelpful,0,1

We ordered salty fish fried rice, general chicken and roasted duck appetizer. The salty fried rice was good. The right amount of fish in the rice and nothing short from amazing. The general chicken caught me by surprise with how crispy it was. The sauce was not over tangy and overly sweet/artificial from what I am used to. Finally, the roasted duck. The plating was essential. Many places I've eaten in Reno that serve duck doesn't offer/include mushu wrap, lotus bun, green onions, and other toppings--but Kwok's does! This was true mushu wrap not the tortilla nonsense other restaurant present you with. They even deboned the duck!

1083,657855651a6d2c7052a63977,"Silver Apple is a weird, weird, very strange place.  First of all, it's not at the address listed.  It's on Bryn Mawr Avenue (just off of Belmont) and the office and ""spa"" room are located in a small servants' quarters behind a large, colonial farm house.  When you walk in, you are faced with a steep staircase and a blast of heat from the laser machine working upstairs.  At the top of the staircase, there are four chairs lined up in an extremely cramped waiting area.  I've never been greeted with a hello when I have arrived because the front-office person has always been on the phone canceling or rescheduling an appointment.  The first time I was there, they had botched up their scheduling and I had to wait an hour-and-a-half for a 15 minute appointment.  The second time was quick, but the woman who runs the show was in a grouchy mood and I heard her say that she refused to wait for the person scheduled behind me who had called to let the office know she was stuck in traffic.  

In addition to the customer service being light on pleasantries, I'm not sure the place is completely hygienic.  All that protects my purific behind from whoever sat on the table last is a little square towel, more like a towelette, that is replaced with each customer (I assume, I hope!).  Also, after the treatment, the Dr. gave me a baby wipe and a tube of cortisone to apply to my bikini area and left the room.  I applied it all myself, which means everyone who goes there does this, which means a lot of hands open and close that cortisone cap.

1087,657855651a6d2c7052a642fd,"First, let me start by saying that I probably suffer from an unfair advantage.  I lived for many years in Los Angeles, and now in New York.   I've eaten many dozens of meals in Persian restaurants, as it is one of my very favorite cuisines, and my Persian friends have educated me in the nuances -- the meats, the rice, the salads, the crispy rice (tadig), all of it.  I don't fancy myself as a connoisseur, just as someone with a deep appreciation for this fantastic cuisine.

That said, House of Kabob is an unmitigated disaster.  The food in -no way- resembles anything like the Persian foods I've eaten so many times.   In fact, I don't know what it resembles, but it is hideous.

Let's start with the most critical element - the rice itself.  Persians pride themselves in washing their rice for hours until it is devoid of starch.  Only then is it prepared, yielding something unimaginably light and fluffy.  It is indeed an embarrassment if two grains of said rice, heavens forbid, should stick together.   Yet the rice at House of Kabob resembles something straight from the kitchens of Uncle Ben.  Heavy, and quite amazingly tasteless.  The flavor and scent of saffron, the world's most expensive and wonderful spice, quite absent.  That unimaginably light quality -- oh no - diametrically opposite -- this is remarkably HEAVY rice.  Awful.

I ordered a combination of chicken breast kebab and koobideh.  Koobideh is a ground meat with spices, shaped into chunks served kabob style.  Normally, it's juicy, savory, loaded with immense flavor from the remarkable spices used in Iranian cooking.  And tender.  This, not so much.   In fact, it was downright rubbery.  Chewy beyond description.  Entirely horrible.

The chicken kebab was equally terrible.  Dry, small cubes -- normally juicy, with hints of lemon and spice -- here just plain, bland, tasteless -- and again, rubbery.

Now, understand - I love, love tadig.  Tadig is the crispy rice formed at the bottom of the Persian rice cooker.  Tradition holds that various stews are poured over the tadig.  So I ordered one of my favorites - Ghemeh.  Normally prepared in a savory tomato concoction including cubed beef, tomatoes, yellow split peas, onions and dried lime.  Ghemeh when cooked properly is a taste sensation - a unique flavor.    This, however, was a total mess -- an amazingly over-salted heap of garbage with the flavor of a heavy brown sauce -- a total absence of tomato tang.  Vulgar. No resemblance to the original cuisine whatsoever.

And lastly, one thing I thought they couldn't possibly screw up.  Mast-o-khiar.  A wonderfully light dip -- made with yogurt, cucumber, dried mint and, optionally, spices.   This particular version was so overwhelmed with dried mint and spices as to be almost green when I opened the container.  Another flop.

I'm terribly sorry.  I don't want to sound mean spirited.  I truly love this cuisine and desperately hoped that House of Kabob would meet my expectations.   But it failed so completely, and so violated my aesthetic, that I can only encourage the restaurant ownership to revisit the origins of the cuisine they claim to prepare and evaluate what they can do to respect and honor a tradition of cooking that is thousands of years old.   Right now, they're light years away.

I won't go back, and I encourage you to give up on finding authentic Persian cuisine in Nashville.  This place delivered only one thing that was authentic: a hot mess.",helpful,1,0

An I dont say this easily. I consider myself a bit of a burger snob. If a burger does not measure up, I let folks know.

This burger is killer. It has a crunch, it has a sweetness akin to teriyaki, but much much better. The pork carnitas are shredded pork, but I would not have known it is pork. It was very tender and some of the best meat I have ever add. An excellent addition to the beef patty.

Artfully arranged over this were the following:  small homemade beef sausages (maybe a dozen of these) which were outstanding -- I normally do not eat red meat and utterly shun any type of sausage.  I ate two of these!  Two grilled flavorful chicken breasts topped by grilled eggplant slices and grilled tomato.  Another wickedly tasty sausage which was chicken with herbs (2 of those).  A pile of gyro meat with tzatziki sauce, two large beef kabobs,  broccoli with melted mozzarella cheese, more grilled eggplant slices and grilled tomato and a couple of slices of feta cheese.  
It was like a treasure hunt for tasty morsels!
Everything is homemade (excepting the cheeses) and is from halal meat.  I found it very salty for my taste and heavy on fat (Well, we are talking sausage!) ... but so outrageously tasty.
This is not where to go for an elegant dining experience but the place to go if you really like lovingly prepared food, pleasant attentive service, reasonable pricing and an acceptable environment. We were too stuffed to try a dessert.  Must do that next time.  I would give it 4.5 stars if possible.   I took the star deduction for excessive salt and I feel guilty doing that, because it is very lovingly prepared.

My car unfortunately broke down, and the police department called silver state to come tow my car. I told the police department I did not need them to tow my car, because I had someone else who could tow it for me. The police department called Silver State and cancelled on the tow truck. Then all of a sudden, a silver state flatbed drives up, and a middle aged man by the name of Don steps out. Don had a horrible attitude, and was extremely rude. We told him we didn't need him to tow the car, cause we could easily push the car into a nearby parking lot, then have my friend pick it up. Don flipped out on us saying he was going to call the police and take my car. He told us we had to pay him $160, even though we never called for him. He said he had to get the car off the road, so he offered to pull it into the parking lot for us. We allowed him to, which was a big mistake on our part. Don then threatened us some more and made us pay the $160 in cash. We had no other choice so we gave him the money. The next day, I walked into the office of silver state and told them I wanted my money back since they didn't nothing with my car. Turns out hooking up a car and pulling it 100ft counts as ""towing"" the car. We had no choice in saying we didn't want the car hooked up. Don had gotten extremely rude and aggressive, and forced us into hooking up the car. Now I have to live with the fact that silver state was able to pocket my $160, and all they had to do was sit on their butts. This place is pathetic, and every single person who works there has a horrible temper problem. It is sad that they are allowed to stay in business. You should never ever call silver state towing company, I promise you will regret it. If I could give them a negative rating, I would.",helpful,1,0

It is a bar, so it was very, very noisey.  I can't fault it for that.  HOWEVER, the menu had bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  So we figured we'd give it a go.
When we got in there, we were seated in the bar area quickly enough- ordered beer, hot wings, coffee and bread pudding.
Beer was pretty quick, coffee was cold- and I mean cold.  Asked her for hot coffee and she said she would make more and that took a while.  The wings came in the mean time and according to husband and uncle, they were good.  There is a plus for the wings.
When we ordered the pudding, they told us it would take 20 mins.- no problem.  About 45 minutes later we were presented with these coffee mugs with......dried bread.  No kidding...dried and flavored bread in a mug that had just come out of the oven.  Sauce?  What sauce?  NONE!  No raisins and no pudding or custard texture at all.  Simply dried bread.
And the service-that sucked.  After she dropped off the wings, she didn't come back for some time.

The inside is simple yet stylish. The red accent tones really pop. The wall of wines is bold and classy looking. We sat along the window on a wooden bench backed with comfy pillows, overlooking the bar. We could also view the busting city outside through the window walls.

Our server Tony did a fabulous job giving recommendations and helpful hints. I ordered Renzo's Steak Salad, which included sirloin, mixed greens, diced eggs, bacon and sliced almonds. We shared a side of Yucca fries and dipped them in a savory garlic aioli blend. He ordered the Brazilian Picanha, which is grilled top sirloin, with a side of mashed potatoes. We both order steak medium-rare but Tony recommended medium for optimum tenderness and flavor. He wasn't wrong. The steak was amazing, especially paired with the Chimichurri. Every bite of everything was completely satisfying.

Sitting across from the full bar tempted us to order mixed drinks. My Hendrix and tonic and his Captain and Coke were concocted perfectly. 

Renzo's is in a hotspot on the corner of 1st ave and 2nd street. The red outdoor patio furniture is eye catching. There are two parking garages adjacent to the restaurant, and metered parking spots on street.

1113,657859931a6d2c7052a657bd,"Overall: Not the best YMCA that Nashville has to offer, but it serves its purpose. 

Positives - 
1. Friendly staff.  Every time.  
2. Affordable. 
3. Hours are reasonable (Downtown has better).  
4. Child care while you work out, but the hours are somewhat limited. 
5. The pool has good hours and is relatively unpopular. 
6. Downstairs yoga room and smaller side room on the first floor offer alternatives to the main gym area and some of its characters.
7. Free parking.  Often crowded in the front, but there's a back lot behind the gym. 

Negatives:
1. Cardio area is less appealing than the downtown gym. 
2. Weight area is rather small and the clientele in this area of the gym leave something to be desired. There is very little space near the dumbbells to exercises off the bench (lunges, sit-ups, RDLS, etc).  And people (nearly always men with headphones in) will park themselves on the benches and not move for 30 minutes. You're hoping to rotate in?  They'll probably pretend you don't exist (you saw the headphones right?), and go back to playing on their iPhone between sets.  This is not a friendly atmosphere.  I've had my water bottle moved out of the way and the bench taken when I go up to get new dumbbells.  When I got back the guy acted like I didn't exist, and every other person there didn't bother saying a word on my behalf.  Another time I offered to spot a guy on his bench and I got the strangest look... not sure if it was the shock of being spoken to, that a someone was offering a spot, or that it was coming from a female.  
3. Pool only has 3 lanes, of which 1 is always dedicated to child swim or aerobics or similar.  That leaves just 2 lanes for lap swimming.  
4. Doesn't open until noon on Sunday.
5. Wish the outdoor pool season was a bit longer.",unhelpful,0,1

There is an Amish Market here in Willingboro, and what makes it an Amish Market is that the stuff is MADE BY AMISH PEOPLE, ie, hand crafted or cooked, using fresh ingredients, from scratch. I just had lunch here that was absolutely TERRIBLE. I'll explain. 

I went here earlier this week with my stepfather, as he was raving about the place. I got a hot roast beef sandwich with gravy, but was on a time crunch and had to get back ASAP. So I had to get it, take it to go and when I got to where I needed to be, had to practically inhale the thing. The sandwich did NOTHING for me, but I chalked it up to the circumstances surrounding my consumption that may have led to the less than stellar experience. SO, I decided to give this place a fair shake and go back when I had a little more time to devote to the experience. Well, I went there today for lunch and had an ABYSMAL turkey sandwich with a infuriating side of mac and cheese. AGAIN, I'm figuring ""Amish Market"" means that this stuff is going to be quality ingredients and slow cooked meats and what not. What I got was PROCESSED turkey slices and fucking stouffers mac and cheese. I threw over half of both in the trash. The turkey wasn't even like deli slices of breast meat. It was chunk, pressed and formed bullshit oscar myer type turkey slices. The mac and cheese was atrocious! They don't even make their own mac and cheese?! C'MON! I've had sandwiches 100 times better from WAWA. Ugh. I knew something was amiss when I noticed all the Amish using blenders and electronic credit card machines.......(seriously though....I'm still totally unclear on this facet; I thought eschewing all things modern and electronic was the Amish way? I'm so confused.) Just because some guy named Jebidiah is rocking a weird beard and some girl in a bonnet is making your sandwich doesn't mean your country market is an Amish one apparently. Its crazy because the place is usually pretty packed. (its also hella small, so that adds to it). Maybe....MAYBE I'll go back to try the hot options or the pies and cakes or something, but I will NOT be getting another sandwich here. Ugh. Severely disappointed.",helpful,1,0

Next, the store.  Cute decor, nice view of woodburning bagel oven in the back, and open but not obtrusive kitchen.  Decor would probably benefit from a bit of warmth here and there, and some big overstuffed chairs, but still very nice, and impeccably clean.

Last, but most definitely not least, the bagels.  Crisp, chewy, packed with flavor, and a welcome departure from the norm.  Smaller than the typical ""New York"" bagel, which in my opinion is nothing but a dense mess of dough (having worked in Midtown for many years, I have had more than my share, so I know from whence I speak), Mount Royal bagels have just the right balance and proportion of 'outer' to 'inner'.

I have to admit, I was not that aware of how sensitive places are to people with food allergies until I had my baby and have to cut out dairy and soy. Fun fact, dairy and soy are in pretty much everything. I now mainly eat salad with no dressing. (Totally kidding, I think I've actually gained weight since he was diagnosed with the food sensitivity because I found all the chips that are soy/dairy free, but I digress.) I've been very wary about eating out because I'm worried about hidden dairy and soy. Turns out FK caters to people like me and my eyes are now opened to the endless possibilities of eating there on a dairy/soy free diet.

Their menu already reflects if something is dairy free, gluten free, sugar free, and vegan friendly. This alone is amazing. I had to ask what was soy free, but the people serving the food were super knowledgeable. 

I couldn't get the sweet potato noodles because it has soy, but they said everything else that is dairy free was also soy free for the bases. I chose kale slaw and cauliflower mash. For veggies, my only choice was the buffalo cauliflower and roasted mushrooms so that made it easy. Proteins I got the baked almond chicken and the chia seed tuna poke (turns out their tuna isn't soy free, so don't make that mistake if you are on a soy free diet. If you aren't, it is still delicious), and all their sauces are soy free (holla) so I got the creamy white ginger. I felt like I was cheating my diet everything was so delicious! The only thing I was on the fence about is the buffalo cauliflower, but that's because it has a kick to it and I don't like spice at all. Next time I'll go double roasted mushrooms and there will definitely be a next time because I am in love. I wish I could just order platters of the baked almond chicken and dip it in the creamy white ginger sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

It was moderately busy on Saturday at lunch time. I thought this place might be only busy on the weekdays when the work crowd is around, but it seems like people are willing to drive to eat here (for good reason.)

They have numerous lunch specials and if your group orders over $45, you get a $5 off Yelp bonus!
 
I stopped in for lunch with my wife.  We entered the regular restaurant (they have another door for the all you can eat sushi) and were seated in a booth in the main dining area.  The lunch menu didn't list everything that I saw online, but we found that if you want something, just ask.  They may just have it!

We looked in the menu and didn't see a soup section so after ordering the lunch special sushi (two 6-pc rolls with Miso soup), I asked if they had egg drop soup that I could exchange for the Miso.  Yes!  Speaking of the egg drop, it had a pleasantly thicker consistency and some al dente vegetables in the soup.  The taste wasn't quite as ""eggy"" as some places I've tried, but it was a pleasing taste and my wife especially enjoyed hers.

I tried the Eel avocado roll (cooked) and the spicy crab roll (raw) for my lunch.  The spicy crab had a nice flavor with just a bit of heat, not too much.  The rolls were tightly packed and held together even when dipped.  The eel roll had a tasty eel sauce (I love eel sauce!) but the fish had a slightly stronger taste than other places I've enjoyed.  Okay, but not my favorite.

My wife went with a Stir Fried Chicken which comes with a soup choice, a filled wonton, and a fried egg roll (veggie).  She thought the meal was just okay, her primary problem was the chicken was lightly breaded and overcooked to give it a bit of chewy texture.  The roll and wonton were okay, but nothing to rave about.  Standard fare.

The staff was generally efficient and courteous, but not very outgoing and welcoming.  The atmosphere was rather dark with the shades down at lunch time which didn't help the experience.  Overall, I would eat here again, but wouldn't make a special trip as a destination meal.

1135,657855651a6d2c7052a6426d,"So I've eaten here a few times since I moved to Boise and I've really had to debate whether it is a 3 or a 4-star restaurant.  This is one of those cases where I really wish I could give a ""half star"" or something like that, because I truly feel like 3-stars is too low, but at the same time, Yelp says 4-stars means ""I'm a fan,"" which I'm really not.  So I used the time honored tactic of................ well ok, I just really asked myself how likely I am to go back again, and that's why I decided on three.  So what's the low down on MFT?  Read on.

First off, yes it is hard to find.  They've set up shop in the cafe of a budget hotel.  I don't hold this against them at all and it is not a factor in the lower rating, but it is a very important factor to note for people trying to find this place.  You won't see much obvious signage.  It is very easy to miss the place.  Basically you're looking for the Roadway Inn just on the south side of I-184 as you're going down Curtis.  And even when you walk in you might still think you're in the wrong place, especially if the wait staff is in the back at the moment and not easily visible.  But trust me, you're in the right place.

The food is...... serviceable.  It's home cooked BBQ, and it gets the job done.  I highly recommend the pulled pork.  The tri-tip was very tender, but just had a bit too much pepper on it for my taste.  It somewhat overwhelmed the meat to me.  The sides are all good enough... but nothing to write home about.  They are better than what you'd get from a box at the store, but they don't scream ""homemade goodness"" to me.  Just very average.  A little ordering trick I would recommend, get the meat sampler ""appetizer.""  This is plenty to feed at least two or three people by itself and you get a good variety of their meats.  As I am not a vegetarian, I cannot comment on the quality of the vegan dishes, but they seem to take it seriously and it is good to see a ""meat"" place offering such robust vegan options so folks like that can eat out together.

The bottom line is that MFT is ""good but not great.""  There's nothing here that really stands out to me, and if I am being honest with myself, if I am REALLY craving BBQ, I'd much rather go to Goodwood.  And maybe that isn't ""fair"" to MFT in a sense, but it just doesn't rank high on my list when it comes to satisfying that desire for BBQ.  That's ultimately the reason for the rating.  It just falls in the middle of the road for me.  Your mileage will vary, of course. :)",helpful,1,0

I was so excited when my boyfriend and I are were invited by a friend and her family to join them for dinner here. I went in having high expectations.

Even without the food, you need to go to Bern's just for the experience. The building doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it's grand and glorious. And crowded! We had a reservation, but still waited in the bar area for while. Once seated we begun the task of the menu. Of course you come for the steak. I don't remember what cut I ordered (this was a few years ago) but it was perfection as expected. Everything surrounding it? Not so much. You get bread and also a salad, vegetables and a baked potato that they fancy up for you tableside. These items aren't exciting and I don't expect them to be, but I would have been happy with just the steak. It is truly the highlight.

After dinner we took the tour of the kitchen and wine cellar, which was spectacular and a must! 

We also went upstairs to the dessert room. It's so easy to get lost up there! Loved the piano player and all of the seperate booths. The desserts aren't the best I've ever had, but they are very good. I would definitely come back just for dessert because I love dessert and the atmosphere can't be beat. This would be a perfect end to a romantic date night. And a cheaper alternative to the full dinner downstairs. Desserts are around an average of $10, which sounds like a lot for a dessert, but considering the place and given a special occasion, it's certainly worth it.",helpful,1,0

It's actually a 4.5-star review but it's not fair to take off a star because the restaurant was so popular that I had to wait 40 minutes for a table.  Their wait system was organized anyway.  They had benches outside and customers could also sit on the curb.  There were a lot of people waiting outside around 6:40 pm on a Friday evening when I came.  It looked like most of the people eating there were locals because some of them apparently ran into each other then or seemed to know the waitresses.

For such a popular and highly-rated restaurant, I expected to see a huge building but it was actually a small, humble storefront on the side of a busy road.  It is located to the right (north) of a seafood market called Fisherman's Cove.  The few parking spots in the front were taken so I parked in the gravel parking lot in the back.  

I am neither a seafood lover nor a fried food lover, but the seafood combo poboy and seafood gumbo were good experiences for me.  The seafood gumbo was very thick and hearty--there was a high density of oysters and all sorts of shellfish.

I got the $9.99 combo of a half-poboy and a cup of gumbo.  It seemed like a really good deal for a big tourist city like New Orleans.  Lots of the customers got oysters and crawfish.  

There were many tables of a variety of sizes in the small restaurant.  They also have a bar where you can eat at.

1150,657855651a6d2c7052a646b1,"Dear Almost Friends at Visionworks, 

I wanted our relationship to work. Having experienced both the overpriced incompetence of Lenscrafters and the ""If it sounds too good to be true, then it's probably not true"" prices of places like America's Best Value and Eyeglass World, I embraced your advertising as a comfortable middle ground. 

So, I entered your Castleton Square location today with enthusiasm and a readiness to purchase a pair of glasses. 

But, oh my, within moments you damaged our relationship beyond repair when your young, undeniably fashionable salesman responded to my inquiry about whether or not Visionworks took my insurance with the question ""Is it Medicaid?"" 

Ouch. This may seem like an innocent inquiry to you, but it's not. It's really, really not. 

As a paraplegic/double amputee who has spent years of my life working when I did, in fact, have the choice of living on disability, the question ""Is it Medicaid?"" was a huge stereotype, a biased inquiry made even more hurtful by an almost flippant and ignorant tone that made it quite clear to me he truly assumed that because I was in a wheelchair and, yes, because I was dressed very casually that I ""must"" be on Medicaid. 

Of course, I quickly corrected him and assured him that ""No, my insurance is not Medicaid"" and, I responded with my employer, an employer whom I'm fairly sure pays their employees more than you pay your retail employees. 

I apologize if that's a slight dig, but I'm still more than a little bothered. 

I suppose I considered it more than a little odd, as well, because at the time of the inquiry I happened to be exploring your high-end frame section - not because I was fantasizing, but because I could actually afford them. 

I tried to muddle my way through the deep offense I took to this inquiry and, in fact, learned that you do actually take my insurance. So, there you have it. My business was there for the taking if you could only overcome that initial faux pas. 

Heck, I'd even found a pair of frames I really liked. Of course, you didn't really know that because this young, fashionable yet completely clueless salesperson seemed to have tired of me after a few denied frames and went off to work elsewhere behind the counter. So, by the time I went back to the counter and asked him what I would need to do in terms of providing a prescription if I was interested in purchasing glasses, I had already resolved to give it a day's thought to allow myself to cool off and decide if these glasses were really ""the one.""

Then, of course, I learned that you had already committed the final act that would dissolve our relationship - your salesman, trying to be helpful I suppose, informed me that he would cancel my authorization as having that would ""get in my way"" elsewhere. 

Um, what? 

I asked you merely tell me if you took my insurance. I didn't ask you to pre-authorize anything. Did you automatically assume that I would surely be so completely captivated by your frame selection that I would ignore being insulted and ignored? Oh, and by the way, please don't tell me that's standard practice as I'm most assuredly not an idiot and I've been dealing with this insurance for years. You went an extra step, an unauthorized step, and could have easily impacted my ability to turn around and buy a pair elsewhere should I so choose. 

So, despite my relative fondness for your frames and my hope that you would serve as a competent, yet fiscally responsible middle ground in my search for new glasses, I left your store mumbling ""Maybe Lenscrafters isn't so bad afterall."" 

Fortunately, that feeling quickly went away. 

I suppose Visionworks is a good name for you. After all, after only a few minutes I certainly saw the light and took my business elsewhere.",helpful,1,0

First Baptiste Style Yoga offered in Edmonton!  Described on their site as warm, fun, & energetic. Their website outlines all the current details and class schedule at: 

http://edmontonpoweryoga.com/ 

Currently they offer an intro 30 days for only $40.  They also offer an energy exchange program where you can volunteer your time in lieu of paying for classes.

I highly recommend checking out into offers like this when deciding if a particular yoga studio is going to be your go to (most studios offer either a 2 week or 1 month unlimited into pass to help figure out if they're the right fit for you).

Staff are super nice from the moment you walk in!  There is a large mat drying area complete with plant based spray to clean and kill germs.  A handicap washroom as well as mens' and ladies' with showers and closed bathroom stalls.  The ladies change room is beautiful, however small.  There are complimentary shampoo/shower gel, q-tips, hair bands, and hair dryers.  No lockers, just cubbies so leave your valuables in your car.

Yoga is taught at 32 degrees which is a great intro as opposed to a 37 or 42 degree hot room.

The yoga studio itself is HUGE with beautiful tones of soft grey throughout and a cheerful chalkboard wall with positive messages. 

If I lived in Summerside or even southside, I would be a moth to a flame in this studio!

Tonight's class was taught by Yvonne & Jen with Carly modeling the poses for us.  It was the Power Beats style with contemporary rap/pop music.  It was a flow with a lot of humour and energy as promised.  They finished and started with a group ohm and placed cool lemongrass scented aromatherapy cloths over our eyes while in Savasana.

Both instructors were easy to follow and easy to hear with the microphone system. 

After class I asked about the other classes and it turns out that the non ""beats"" classes are taught with zero music.  So if you want music, definitely pick ""Beats.""

Now, if only they can open a studio on the north side - I'd be a happy camper!

There just doesn't seem to be that many options in the area for fresh veggie bowls. I can think of Fresh Kitchen but they only have a couple of locations in Tampa Bay. So recently, when a friend suggested Freshii, I got excited and had to just check it out for myself.

Here are my ratings based on different criteria:

Quality of food: Good. I ordered Biiblos which has quinoa, spinach, walnuts, chickpeas, feta cheese, dried cranberries, cucumber, carrots, spicy harissa tahini dressing. They have an option to add falafel or protein for extra cost but I chose to just stick with the basics. Everything tasted fresh. The dressing could have had more flavor though. I have eaten tahini based sauces many times before and this was the least flavorful sauce that I have ever had. I had to use Sriracha to the rescue.

Decor: okay. The place looked modern but lacking in any sort of art or decor. The outside area was well covered under huge unbrellas.

Cleanliness: good. No complaints. All the tables and outside areas were kept neat and clean.

Service: fast and friendly. The owner/cashier took my order and described all the options to me pretty well. The only thing was that they don't have a water dispenser that a guest can just walk up to. You have to ask the people behind the counter for a refill which gets to be a little painful when they're busy.

Speed of food preparation: quick. The lunch rush hour had quite a few people standing in line and the folks looked a little overwhelmed but it still only took less than 5 mins for my name to be called...granted I was 3rd in line when I got here.

Price: pricey. My bowl without any added protein came out to around $9 after tax which is a little high for a quick meals type of a place.

This is a good healthy option if you're in the area. I think that Fresh Kitchen is still better as they cook their veggies and have more variety for toppings.",helpful,1,0

1175,657855651a6d2c7052a64190,"Love Cakes Bakery is in the storefront that was formerly Lilly Jane's Cupcakes until purchased by a new owner / baker in Summer 2018 and what a difference she has made!  This bakery is splendiferous for the European style sweet treats the new owner bakes.  Lidiia is from Ukraine and in addition to being charming she is super talented with a background as a professional baker.  While she makes cupcakes in oodles of flavors in both standard and mini size it is her addition of European styled baked goods including layer cakes, tortes of several kinds made of what seems impossibly thin multiple cake layers filled with incredibly delicious buttercreams, cream puffs and macarons that caught my tastebuds' attention.   Not to mention the cheesecakes she made last winter that ""took the cake"" as the saying goes.

My husband and I have eaten our way through a variety of Lidiia's baked goods since discovering her shop last Fall and have enjoyed every one.   Be sure to try a slice of Lady Delight Torte (my hubby's fav so it isn't gender specific for name :-) ), the Honey Cake (a Ukraine tradition and my fav),  the Caramel Pecan Torte, any cheesecake when she makes them, the Lemon Almond Cake and...well, you see the trend is try one goody here and you'll want to try them all.  And while we never have been so much cupcake eatin' people, we sure do like her lemon cupcakes with a bit of lemon curd in them.

Lidiia's prices are reasonable too for the top notch quality of all of her baked goods.  Cupcakes are $1.50 for mini and just under $3 for regular size.  Macarons are $1.50 each - discounted a bit if you buy a dozen and you'll be glad you did if you do!  She also has some of the European styled cakes and tortes available by the slice from about $3.50 - $4.25.  And in the style of European baking, the cakes and tortes are delightfully sweet enough but not the cloying sweetness one finds in mass market baked goods in many supermarkets.  

Lidiia also updated the interior of this shop to give it a fresh and welcoming look and everything absolutely sparkles with pride of ownership, including the refrigerated display cases.  

I'm remembering celebrity cook / entertainer Ina Garten's good advice: ""My guests do not have a better time at my dinners if I make the dessert.""   In other words, sage advice to buy dessert and let yourself off the hook.  Yes indeed.  Buy dessert at Love Cakes and everyone will be delighted.  And you'll be helping a hard working and talented new business owner be successful.  (Save a piece of whatever it is you buy for me!)

There are a couple of small tables inside with total seating for maybe five or six people so eat in is possible but this may be more a place where you'll want to buy goodies  to take with you.  

PARKING:  Private lot with a good number of spaces. 

ACCESSIBILITY: ADA parking spaces near the door. Level in the door from the sidewalk, all on one level, ample room at counter and displays for a wheelchair user to navigate.",helpful,1,0

Do not waste your time with this company.

After 2 more weeks & nothing happening, i called again & she informed me that I'd have to drive to her location -- about 50 minutes each way for me - -to pick up the sample.  Since the cabinet was coming in at $3,200, which is significant, and it was obvious they didn't want my business, I cancelled the order.

The decor was impressive as it created a cool vibe but after the food was served i realized it was all just a front. kinda like those d-bags with the 'can't let it go' spiked hair and receding hair line sporting ed hardy t-shirts. 

I find it unusual that the diners have the choice for the side dish for the entree course. I'd rather have the chef put together a well thought out dish. I chose the roasted veggies paired with the miso crusted sea bass figuring this would have been the most ideal option out considering the the alternatives. The fish was too sweet and overpowered by the miso. The crust was soggy on the side the fish was resting on. Would have been better if the crust was just on one side which would have taken care of both shortcomings. 

My wife had the braised short ribs and requested a side of mac and cheese. The braised short ribs were more like a stew. The mac and cheese had a runny sauce though it had a nice crust. It was more like macaroni and runny cream sauce.

There IS a pretty rowdy bar at night on the corner that may give the block an unsafe feeling to some but coming from NY, I prefer safety in numbers rather than a less populated area that is farther away from help.

Both checking-in and my room change request were quick and painless.  After seeing my original room, I had to request a change due to a weird funk on the floor and then an even odder smell inside my room.  My second room was significantly smaller but the room size change didn't bother me much since I was only staying for 1 night and would be spending most of the time outside for a wedding.  

Each room lists its longitude and latitude coordinates next to the room number, perhaps something that all the Meridien hotels have.  Inside the room is a neutral color palette with red curtains for accent to give it that streamlined, modern feel.  My particular view on the 9th floor looked out onto the not-so-attractive backsides of buildings but the bed and pillows themselves were really comfortable.  I didn't get to sleep in before checking out the next day but I was out like a light the minute my head touched down.  And a shout-out goes to the clean and neat bathroom, especially the shower that I used with no reservations.  Unlike Jenn C., I did have the expected soap, shampoo and lotion but didn't take any home because they were quite drying and weren't scented anything special.

Every employee we encountered was courteous and helpful.  At one point, we were stuck within an elevator that just closed but refused to move.  We managed to escape by forcing open the door and someone came to address the problem promptly.  

My only major gripes would be about the ventilation system and the lack of soundproofing.  The former was definitely not as old and loud as some I've experienced but I couldn't find a happy medium between warm/stuffy and cold.  As for the latter, I woke up in the middle of the night because someone closed the door across the hallway... and I'm on the heavier side of the sleeper spectrum.

A week later I called to leave a message that I now own the home.  A day later, no return call, so I left a second message and waited 2 days.  Again no return call.

The place was decorated in what looked to be local art, which was fun and relaxed and offered a small-town feel.  The restaurant was playing the likes of Johnny Cash and The Beatles, and that alone offered zero complaints from me.

Boyfriend and I shared chips and queso, and then moved on (reluctantly) to our tacos - that queso is yummy!  I got the fish taco and the smoked brisket taco, and boyfriend got the Korean bbq taco and the lime chicken (or something like that?) taco. All I know was that the fried haddock was heavenly, and the brisket was perfectly seasoned and super smokey and delicious.  The table was pretty quiet other than ""mmm"" sounds, so I think boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well.

I may have dipped my brisket taco in the queso, only to see the woman at the next table glance in my direction at that exact moment.  The look I received was most likely envy, although it may have been disgust.  No matter, boyfriend saw me do it, and jumped in on the fun.  Needless to say, the queso didn't last long.

The biggest complaint is that there is NO AIR CONDITIONING. They did include a fan.  It blew.

OK, so I had to sleep with the windows open--- only there are NO SCREENS. (Score 1 for the flies!  It's called FIESTA INN because it gives bugs a place to FIESTA because they can get INN)  

I was wary to sleep with the screenless window open.  I felt that an arm could come forcefully in at any time.  Now I know how Andy Dick's anus feels.

The biggest problem with STL coffee shops is the frequent turnover of ownership, and Mississippi Mud was touch-and-go there for awhile with a pretty steady turnover rate of employees, but as of like 2 months ago (April 09), I would have to say they are the most improved shop in town thanks largely to both the new owners and also the old baristas who braved through the most recent ownership change (and who- by the way- make charming latte art that I'm very glad is still around).

Lately everything from the art on exhibit, to the spacious, homey rearrangement of the furniture, to the paninis (which are finally one excellent panini bread!), and of course the coffee, is excellent.

Here's to hoping things keep going strong- it looks like they will. As of now, if you're looking for an excellent mocha, home-baked pastries, or friendly baristas, the Mud is not a coffee shop to miss.",unhelpful,0,1

First off, I am more of a beer/wine girl and less of a mixed drinks/liquor girl, BUT if I had to choose one place in Reno for craft cocktails, Chapel would be my first pick(there are a couple close second and thirds so read my other reviews if you want more suggestions). WHY? You might ask in capital letters? First, I love their bartenders. Actually, I love one bartender in particular and her name is Sara. I have only been to Chapel on Sundays(appropriately so) so I know she is definitely there during the day(yes, I occasionally day drink on Sundays! Don't judge!!). Sara is super knowledgable and makes excellent drinks. Just look at the ones she made for me!(see attached pics). 

Speaking of which, the second reason why I love Chapel: their BLOODY MARYS!! I mean just look at it! Comes with its own grilled cheese sammie for crying out loud! 

Third and finally, I love the space. It's such a great bar to sit at. You have a great view of everyone at the bar. Dunno why I like that. Feels communal somehow. They also have great outside seating during the warmer months and one of those giant garage doors.

1268,657855651a6d2c7052a63c90,"It's quite unfortunate that I must give at least one star in order to leave a review for this establishment. My significant other, my best friend, and I recommended this restaurant for a night out for dinner and drinks with some friends from out of town. We were looking for something low key, with a variety of drink options and a food menu. We, as a group, decided to all have wings as our entree. First of all, under the menu description for the wings, the very first statement is that the restaurant doesn't split flavors or sauces (which is already a rarity when ordering wings, anywhere). We inquired about this to the waitress, there were five of us, we planned on ordering at least 40 wings, obviously we don't all want the same flavor. Not that big of a deal, I suppose, we just all each chose the 10- wing option. 20 were traditional, 20 were boneless. When they came the the table, they looked pretty good! But, the boneless didn't taste it. Everyone at the table agreed. They were pretty dry, and over cooked. The traditional ones were plump and full of sauce... When the waitress (finally) came back to the table, the boneless had been tasted by most of us, and generally agreed they were not up to par, she asked how everything was. Now, I'm not typically one to complain about food... but I was hungry, and she asked! So I told her, they were pretty dry, and not really that good at all... could I have some sauce for them? Maybe that'll help? She said ""okay"" (not, ""I'm sorry"") and went to get the sauce. After a short while a DIFFERENT waitress came to our table and started interrogating us about the comment regarding the boneless wings. ""What was wrong with them?"" ""Dry, like how?"" ""How was your appetizer?"" (Unrelated)... my best friend finally compared the boneless wings to McDonald's chicken nuggets, then the waitress started yanking the plates of food off the table telling us ""we don't have to look at it anymore"". Let me explain, she never once ever apologized, or offered to speak with her manager, or offer to get us something else to eat/fresh wings/etc. There was never the offer to reconcile the situation. I'll also say, I wasn't looking for one. I'm just reflecting how the entire situation played out. So we continued to catch up with our old friends and start our second round of fresh drinks when the manager/owner approached the table. She carried the same confrontational, interrogative demeanor, asking each one of us what we had and what exactly was wrong with it. She never apologized for us being dissatisfied with our meal, and even asked why ""so much was gone"" when it was sent back. Well, there were five of us, you do the math. Remember, I never called the waitress over to complain about my food... SHE asked ME how it was. She then accused us  of HARASSING her waitress! She just kept saying ""The chicken is fresh, I saw the food come out"". She had to had said it three times and at this point, I became hot. I said ""DID YOU TASTE IT? BECAUSE I DID!"" I am not one to get confrontational, especially to a stranger. This is the owner of an establishment, standing in front of me, head bobbing with her hand on her hip, the attitude of a bratty seventeen year old, angry that I gave a poor report about an item on her menu... I demanded my check. I was done, I didnt even want to finish my drink. I asked and demanded for the check over and over and she just kept standing there with her hand in her hip. Then I threatened to leave without paying if she did not get my check!! (I WAS STILL WILLING TO PAY! WE ALL WERE!) I've never walked out on a bill before. She yelled at us to leave and stiff the waitress, that she'd be stuck covering the bill (this is an outburst in front of other customers). It was just absolutely embarrassing and surreal and none of us could believe what we had just experienced. I will not only never recommend this establishment but I would advise AGAINST it.

         I have gone to this diner many times. There food is delicious and there is lots of it. There prices are very reasonable. The people that own the business are Turkish. They really know how to prepare their dishes. The staff there is well trained and fast. As soon as you are seated they come and take your drink order. The manager himself comes and does this also to make sure everyone is seated quickly and will be ready to order in a matter of minutes. The portions are large. I have ordered chicken casadias many times and they are one of the best in the area. They are thick and loaded with grilled chicken, veggies and lots of cheese. Their breakfasts are also large and very tasty. They don't skip on anything and their waiters and waitresses are very friendly. It is a great place to eat and socialize with your friends. The good thing is that they are  open 24 hours/day.

Because of what happened last year (what do you mean we're cut off?!), it was decided that a new location was to be found, which happened to be Roadhouse. 

Now, I understand, it's Christmas Eve. You don't want to be here. I'm sorry. But if you have to be here, why not be cheery since, I don't know, as a server your pay is directly related to your demeanor/service? 

Our server was efficient. Not nice, but efficient. She looked like she was pissed at us the entire time; so much so, that I even asked her--half jokingly--to not spit in my food, which, immediately after, I realized was a terrible mistake because now she was certainly going to spit in my food. 

Maybe that's why the food was terrible. I take that back, the waffle fries were awesome, but you can't really mess up the most perfect food in the world.

Anyway, I had the barbeque sampler, since they were billing themselves as a barbeque joint, and it was so bad that I think Mrs. Poochie herself was in the kitchen (SNAP! Past-reference-slam!). I didn't realize that you could smoke ribs in a microwave. Wait, you can't? Oh.
 
Seriously, they said that they were ""known"" for their barbeque spaghetti, but I would rather eat Chef Boyardee. It was ridiculously sweet, and if I hadn't gotten drunk later that night, and the requisite hunger that accompanies said drunkenness, it would've been pitched out. In college I used to get polluted and eat Que Bueno nacho cheese out of the gallon container when I was drunk, certainly I can handle ""Barbeque Spaghetti.""

I mean, it's a nonprofit bike shop that is suppose to be for the communities best of interest... Right? But you really get is some pretentious a$!holes. When you go into a location that was begun with the motto, ""How can we make bicycles and bicycle education available to the entire community?"" Well, I'll give you an example of the hello you get when you walk into the door........ Yeah silence is about it, but you do get a sassy look from one of the paid staff. What a way to walk into a place that is suppose to be helping you! I could only imagine a person that knows nothing about a bike and is shy to learn about them walking into this place. 

I will begin with my last two experiences at Boise Bike Project: 

I walked in to a big woman sitting in a chair that just eyed me all wrong without greeting me or even saying anything. I asked, "" can I use a bike pump real quick, cause I think my bike pump just shot the s^|t and didn't pump my tires up adequately."" She was not busy btw, but she had time to roll her eyes and point to the bike pump leaning against the wall. I guess I was in the wrong and definitely felt uncomfortable to use their bike pump that is free at every bike shop in Boise! 

Second time going into BBP, I was looking for a bike part and I was going to have them assist me with some bike maintenance. They were busy with a couple of people, so I just asked for the bike part and was pointed in the direction of the bolt bins. I bring my dog with me everywhere I go... Mainly cause she is a SERVICE DOG! Now because I let my dog be a dog, I will not put her vest on unless she is required to for a location of business or whatever. Just so you know, I have PTSD from being Army Infantry for 6 years and spending 2 of which in the Middle East, so taking a service dog with me everywhere is legally legit. She was not identified as a service dog at the time so I won't press anymore on the topic. Jimmy brings his dog to work on a daily basis and his dog is not friendly, matter fact, that dog tried attacking my service dog. When I asked who's dog it was everyone acted like I didn't say anything and kept doing what they were doing like nothing happened, so I began to leave and that freaken dog tried to attack my dog again on the way out. I don't think a good citizen of the community should have this issue at a nonprofit. This especially when this topics was brought up later to the owner  (Jimmy Ha) of the dog was brought to the attention of the matter and his response was, ""I don't understand why people bring their dogs to the shop all the time?"" To that statement I say, ""You take your dog to work almost everyday you dumba$$!"" I actually think my service dog is smarter than this guy. Sorry, guess I shouldn't talk about the founder of this establishment like that. Maybe a founder should apologize for the actions of his people and beast instead of diverting the blame into somebody else's problem while in a conversation with a person that has concern about his establishment. 

I am a avid cyclist that can give a normal person advice about where to buy, fix, or work on your bike around town without using BBP. So I will leave my personal email if anyone needs assistance.

Burger:  2 star
Bun was soggy, sauce was actually better than the one in Philly because I think they put more on the burger.  Meat was decent.  Nothing to write home about.  Cheese was not flavorful.  The size of the burger was ridiculously small.  They want you to order the double, which is $7.20, apparently.

Then, one fateful afternoon, I stumbled upon a sight I thought I'd never see: Dinic's with no line! Of course, I had to dash over to snatch up a sandwich.

For our first visit, we had the classic roast pork and the brisket. Both of us actually found the brisket way more delicious-possibly even worth the looooong wait in line and being tortured by the surrounding smells and sights of delicious Reading Terminal Market food. Definitely worth the price, especially for the brisket. Juicy, tender, savory meat stuffed in freshly baked bread that seemed a little delicate for the meaty beast it contained. I couldn't imagine taking this sandwich to go, for fear that it would become a soggy mess. I recommend the sharp provolone, broccoli rabe, and peppers on top. Heaven, in a plastic basket. Hell, I'd give it five stars for the brisket alone.",helpful,1,0

As I can never recall having Russian cuisine other than when I ate here.  Most of the other reviews seem to like this place, so until I had a chance to give it one more try this is my review.

We had a variety of dishes and the smoked fish platter was good, the other foods were all to pickled, or sour for my liking.  I enjoy sweet meats mostly or either a spicy...exploding dish full of flavor and buttery, or creamy and milky.

To me it seems as though everything had pickles or sour dill flavors to it and sometimes so much dill that is was way to overpowering for my taste buds.  A lot of dill is used in their dishes.  I am sure I can find something in the Russian cuisines that I would love, I will just have to try more Russian dishes to find it.

If everything is dill heavy, I will not love Russian food probably ever...so I am not going to knock this place as the server was great and the food looked very appealing.  I will tell you the one part of the meal I thought was great but a bit pricey...the Russian Vodka, man that stuff was great.  It is just as I named it, Russian Vodka, I have no idea what kind, but I really enjoyed that.  Maybe you are supposed to have a few of the Russian vodkas and the food will be great?

Nothing bad can be said about this place by me, as I never give a restaurant a bad kick, because I have an undeveloped pallet, so by the next time I eat Russian cuisine again, hopefully my taste buds are more adapt at enjoying this cuisine.",helpful,1,0

If you wear a tie they will ring an alarm, cut it off and hang it on the wall. She thought this would be fun, we bought a tie, which she decorated. As my husband, daughters and I were being seated i told the hostess that we were celebrating my daughter's 9th birthday, she said we should let our server know, which we did. 
The birthday girl had a kids ribs and I had the full rack of ribs, they were tender, but I thought were too salty. My husband and older daughter had the slow roasted beef, one with gravy and one with bbq sauce, which they both enjoyed. The birthday girl had the kids ribs, and made a happy plate. Kids had 2 Root beers and we had 2 iced teas. Our bill was $70 and change. 
Throughout dinner my daughter waited with anticipation for the tie cutting, even laying her tie on the table for the waiter to see. Half way through, I took her to the restroom so my husband could remind the waiter about her birthday and tie. After finishing our dinner and sitting with dirty dishes for 10 minutes, we received the bill. I gave him my debit card thinking while he is running the card they will come and cut my daughters tie and hang it with the others and at least wish her happy birthday.

1306,657855651a6d2c7052a64579,"I feel like I should be able to rate this place in two different ways.  One for the actual process and facility and one for the treatment and healthcare providers.

1. Facility and process - The place is new and beautiful. When you enter they have a very pleasant lobby that is spotless.  The entire place actually was spotless and I really like that.  It didn't have that depressed, dingy feeling most places like this have.

The staff that took my information were ok. They weren't overly friendly but they weren't rude either.  I had an appointment and I had filled out my registration paperwork online prior to coming in that day.  I also still arrived about 10 minutes early for my appointment.  

I was checked in and then later called back to the office person because apparently they saw where I pre-registered but they were unable to get that information.  So I had to fill out and sign a few forms I had already done online.

I ended up waiting a good while to get in.  I spent 30-40 minutes in the waiting room.  Of course I have no knowledge of other people's appointment times etc but there were about 3 people who arrived after me and were taken in before me.

Finally they called me back, took my vitals and they ushered me into a room.  The person informed me that there was only one patient ahead of me.  I was happy knowing maybe my waiting was over.  Not so fast, I ended up waiting another 50 minutes to see the doctor.  In the meantime, I had to again fill out more paperwork since my pre-registration wasn't able to be pulled up.  I hate having to do things twice because someone else screwed up.

I honestly was ready to walk out.  I came very close to leaving.  It was so frustrating to sit there in that tiny, freezing room.  Finally the doctor came in.  He was quick, thorough and actually quite enjoyable.  

I was happy that after seeing the doc the staff was quick to bring me my paperwork and discharge me.  

2. Healthcare providers - Everyone I dealt with here as far as nurses or MA's were fantastic.  The doctor specifically was wonderful.  I felt like he really listened to me and responded to what I was saying.  He asked me questions and was friendly and joked around but he didn't waste time either.  He was patient and he let me ask questions too.  I was most impressed that before he left the room he looked at me directly and asked if I felt comfortable with everything we had talked about that day and if I had any more questions.  It was so refreshing to see a doctor that is efficient without being rushed.  Honestly this doc was the saving grace of the entire experience.  

I ended up leaving happy knowing that I got some sound advice and even though the rest of the experience was poor.

I hope they can get it together here.  It is a great location and the facility itself is quite nice.",helpful,1,0

After the housekeeping staff of the Siena Hotel in Reno stole the pashmina I'd specially ordered from Taiwan in just the right color purple to match the dress I was wearing to my sister in law's wedding, I had little hope of finding a replacement--let alone finding one in tourist trappy, Disney-does-Old West Virginia City. But Kashmir saved the day with their incredible selection of fine angoras, pashminas, cashmeres, and just about every other kind of exotic textile you can imagine. They also sell beautiful rugs that I didn't even get a chance to really peruse. The owner, Tariq, was extremely informative and helpful about the choices, and just a nice guy all around. The prices are also very reasonable for what you're getting, which is very high quality merchandise. Tariq told us that his family has been in the business for years: his father led special missions into the mountains to procure the fabric he used to tailor the American ambassador's suits in Delhi. Really a neat, authentic little shop in an unexpected location, and well worth a visit to escape the dress up and Old Tyme photo shops that populate Virginia City's main strip, even if you don't have a purpose in mind like I did. These are a lot of superlatives for me, but I couldn't recommend it more highly. It saved my wedding outfit.",helpful,1,0

Sure enough that came around to bite me in my yellow butt: discovered I had to get a bunch of other stuff replaced/repaired around it cuz I waited too long. A totally broke grad student's nightmare. Sorry no Christmas gifts for anyone.
Total cost to replace everything in order to get it highway safe = $1100.

I didn't even have half that money so I didn't have a choice but to leave without getting a thing fixed, risking my life and the lives of my youth group students I give rides to each week. sucks to suck.

On the drive home I was bummed and felt desperate so I called Jamie the manager to just let him know what my situation was: broke youth pastor, broke grad student, I don't want to die or kill, help a bro out please! 
He called me back with some fantastic news: He went out of his way to find used parts, knocked the labor down as much as he could and went to bat for me and asked his boss if I could pay what I had now and pay the rest in a month or so. $400 off AND they trusted me to pay them back?! He must have seen my Bible in the back seat or something. I was blown away by their service and Jamie's go-the-xtra-2-miles attitude. 

The next day, everything was fixed and now I'm back to being a safe Asian driver (btw, NOT an oxymoron...at least not always). Also, I love Jesus but no I did not Tebow in the parking lot when I picked up my car.

1). Don't wait to get ish fixed!!!!
2). If you need a dollar, don't ask for 50 cents.

I had heard so much about Mi Nidito from TV shows and had wanted to eat here for a long time. After reading reviews I knew I'd be in for a wait no matter what time I came. We got here around 8:30 on a Friday and the wait was about 35-40 minutes for a party of 2. 

The whole restaurant has a cozy but festive feel. There's a lot of dim yellow lighting and brightly colored decor. Waiting close to 40 minutes gives you a lot of time to look at the menu so I knew  that I wanted the famed President's Platter, the very meal that Bill Clinton had feasted on when he visited Tucson in 1999. It comes with a beef tamale, birria taco, chile relleno, bean tostada, and chicken enchilada. After eating it I can see why he needed to have a quadruple bypass surgery! It was a hefty amount of food for sure. My favorites were the taco and tostada, but unfortunately the giant bed of lettuce plated underneath them caused them to have (In a Mary Berry, Great British Baking Show voice)... A Soggy Bottom. No one wants a soggy bottom. 

Despite it being so busy, service was pretty good. We were checked up on as needed and drinks were refilled frequently.

Working with the event planner was very easy and quick in responding, however I found the disposition of the person a little on the short side despite my being as pleasant as possible.

The night before calling to confirm my reservation, they said no party was in the private area the day of my reservation so they would put me in there.

When I inquired, the waitstaff was apologetic as there was no notes left on my reservation about this, and the party room had not been ""serviced"" yet so there was no way we could get in the room.

Seating was in a huge disarray during mardi gras, but its probably alot more structured otherwise. 

You must order the oysters with a drink, the cheapest drinks are jello shots which they ran out of, so we got shots of rumchata instead. 

The chargrilled oysters here are different from other restaurants in nola. They are way more spicy,  and are drowning in red chili oil, this dish would be so delicious with some rice. The regular raw oysters are also very fresh, large, and tasty.

I ordered a cactus pear margarita, scott got the traditional version and PEM a beer. My margarita was delicious but as others have stated very weak and very sweet.

Ordered some chips and salsa as they are not complimentary.  The salsa was a nice fire roasted salsa with a touch of heat. Decided to get some queso as well and it was a very weak example of queso. Made with mozzarella so it was very stringy and although tasted eh ok belonged more on a pizza than a tortilla chip. 

For dinner scott ordered the tinga tacos. ..spicy chicken 3 per order.  PeM had the churassco ..served with rice and beans and an odd folded tortilla with green salsa on it... and I had the enchiladas with red green and white sauce. Although everything was ok...nothing wowed and the portions for the guys seemed awfully small. My portion was fine though.

The young girl up front asked how many in our group.  I told her 6.  She said perfect, we are sending groups of 6 back at a time.  She said just put one name and number down.  She said that they would call us in about 2hrs.  We go and find something to do for that time.  We get back 2 hrs later at 8.  The young girl is no longer at the front and a young guy takes her place.  We ask him what's going on. We are no longer on the list.  He said they started a new list. I was not to happy to hear that.  I was pretty upset about it. We told him we were there way before everyone else.  He pulls the old list out of trash and sees how far up the list we were and puts us back on.  We then ask how long, like 2 hrs we ask?  He then laughs in our face and says ""if your lucky"".  He then says come back in 3 hrs. He says, didn't worry, last time we stayed open till 3am to get to everyone.  So.... AGAIN..... We find something to do. He said he will call us. So... We come back again at 11.   The young kid says again... Its gonna be about an hr. Come back. Ok.... So.... We go and eat at dennys.  We get back an hr later. We go inside and they tell us they arent doing anymore tats. The RUDE tattoo artist (dont know his name, but he was a tall husky dark skinned guy with black hair)  said ""I refuse to do anymore tats"".

Everyone likes to cry about the new ownership, and how it's ""not what it used to be"" but let's just take a second here to appreciate a great little business for what it is.

Now I know that the former owner of this bakery gem was loved and respected but she moved on and sold the business to a new owner who has bread in his genetics by the sound of things.  A bakery is a wonderful thing to support, especially on 99th Street where cute boutique stores should be worshiped, not shunned. 

This is why...  As a resident of the Mill Creek area, I am afraid of beautiful businesses like Tree Stone not making it.  If Tree Stone ceased to exist, some Money Mart, or sketchy Donair place would open in it's place!  After all, the former owner left because her nose was broken in a break in!  

Do we want more people like this in a neighbourhood that needs a little help?  I didn't think so.

Full story: We decided to eat before devouring ourselves with some yummy beignets from Cafe Du Monde. The place didn't seem so empty so the three of us ordered plates of chicken. Simple enough right? three orders with three numbers so we each received our number and placed it on the table. After 15 mins of waiting I decided to check out the kitchen area since they have a full view inside the restaurant. One guy was cooking and the same guy was delivering. Okay I get it, short staffed, so we wait a little longer. Turns out they have their ordering backwards because people who ordered the food after us were getting it first and the people who ordered before us were still waiting. Two of us got our food after 25 mins, and after 35 mins we went to the cook to ask for the third order. They ignored us for a while and when we asked they said another 10 mins.

Kitchen - 4 stars
I was a bit apprehensive about eating great seafood at such a run down dive bar. A burger? Sure, but seafood? As many things in the area, you must keep an open mind. We over-ordered thanks to waiting entirely too long to get fodo and thus ordered all of the following:

Seafood Mac'n Cheese: So yummy! Should be served in a pretty plate instead of plastic basket to really be enjoyed properly, but really great taste.

Fried Scallops: SKIP THIS. I ordered the $9 order and they were so tiny they looked like fried pickles instead of scallops. 

Crab loaded fries: Also, totally unnecessary to get shredded crab and cheese on fries. It really didn't add much flavor either, so I would pass.

Lobster Po'boy: GET THIS! GET TWO OF THESE! This sandwich was soooo amazing. It is served in a perfectly soft roll, crispy giant chunks of lobster, and a fabulous sauce lathered all on top. The thing was as big as my forearm, and only $13. 

Overall, some good eats, I will definitely be returning, but more for takeout.

Bar - 2 star

We sat at the bar to grab a drink while we waited and it was an older lady tending to the bar. There was a drink special written on a board, I asked what that was and she plainly said, ""I don't know how to make that."" Fabulous, maybe taking it off the board would be a good idea, considering the next customer that walked in had the same question.

The main difference between a dive bar and run down bar is maintance. Dives might have a few messed up tiles, or a crack in the wall. This bar has every single tile broken, disgusting stuff hanging from the ceiling, broken mirrors lining the walls, and rude service. I get that this is not a place that gets a ton of business, but a few things fixed would do wonders. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the pour was great on my drink and they did have lots of vodka options.",helpful,1,0

I recently visited your Silver Legacy Hotel and Casino, staying Saturday overnight  December 11, 2010. I stayed with a longtime friend. Although I have visited Reno casinos several times (Atlantis in particular) this was my first visit to your casino and hotel. I signed up for a silver legacy card to use in the slot machines and unfortunately soon misplaced it. You can easily verify this by seeing that my card needed to be replaced. Needless to say, since we were paying for a hotel room at Silver Legacy, a good amount of money was spent on your slot machines so we did not have to walk around to find slot machines. I did recieve a free comp drink to which I happily tipped the very nice male drink server but for the rest of that Saturday afternoon into late evening, that was my only comp'd drink.
 
A friend of mine who lives in Reno, came to visit around 3 or 4am Sunday. We sat at a slot machine near your Silver Baron lounge. I told him that I felt dissapointed about the lack of comp'd drinks despite a good amount of money being spent on the slot machines. A older (40s-50s years old) short filpina woman carying a drink tray, walked by our slot machines. My friend asked her if she would bring us by two drinks. She stopped in her walk with a noticably annoyed face and said ""you need me to get you something huh?"" with the most annoyed voice you can imagine. My friend and I both thought ""wow""
 
my friend said ""yes please, and we will be right here"". She looked at my machine and my friend's and said ""you need to put more money in there to get free drinks"".
 
Very logical, I was transferring a ticket from another machine where I had only .80 cents left. I put in about 10 more dollars. She came back about 25 minutes later. 25 minutes is a long time. When she did return, she was very annoyed and scowled at us ""I've been watching you and I don't like the way you are gambling because you need to spend money. I remember your faces. (this is verbatum what she said) I remember both your faces you are not gambling"".
 
So paying for a hotel room, spening a good amont of money on your casino to be awarded a scolding that sounded more like a mom scolding a 6 year old, I hope you will understand why I really do not want to return to your hotel OR Casino for my next visit to Reno. I was told this woman's name. She was very demeaning, curt and unprofessional. Without disclosing my employer, I do work at our corporate office and have been left with this memory to share with anyone who expresses interest in visiting Reno. If this is the kind of staff you employ and behavor you condone, it is not an experience I would want anyone to have.
 
Again this was around 4am on Sunday, December 12,2010, we were sitting at slots near the Silver Baron Lounge. I've never been spoken to like that by another adult (who wasn't homeless) before.

The salon isn't anything fancy, but clean.  Offered us a beverage, and staff seemed helpful.  We sat within 10 minutes without an appointment, and they did a decent clean up job on my eyebrows.

That's about as good as it gets there.  

We got the ""upgraded"" pedicure packages but didn't feel we got any extras compared to any other salon.  

On top of it, the guy doing my girlfriend's nails hit on her a couple of times and offered to help father her children if she needed (I'm pregnant so kids were the topic of conversation for a little bit)...which in our opinion was taking it a little too far and made her a little uncomfortable.  

My french pedicure was chipping within 1.5 weeks!  I couldn't believe it.  I've never had a pedicure that didn't last at least a month.

We also got gel manicures, and mine were chipping within 5 days, and hers within a week.  

For a bill over $100 for me and about $80 for her we were pretty disappointed with the service.

We both agree each other's company was the main advantage of the time we spent at Venetian...and luckily we can do that anywhere.",helpful,1,0

The ""crab"" cake was a joke. It had very, very little crab in it and a bunch of whatever the filler is they use, not at all worth buying.

There is a nice size bar (serving food) to cozy up to with tables or comfy couches and a private room. Great cocktails, wine list and they offer local craft brews and hard liquor. Terrific wine selection and prices for upcoming gifts. The friendly servers and bartenders are very knowledgeable about their wines so don't hestitate to ask questions. Enjoy a glass of award winning wines from Napa and Sonoma while taking in the historic racing memorabilia or watching a sporting event.

Foyt's Wine Vault, opened in 2015, is located on Main Street in historic downtown Speedway with ample street parking and the facility is handicapped accessible. 10 minutes from downtown Indy and just a few blocks from the legendary Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS). Depending on the night or week, it may be just a few patrons or many. They have several events throughout the various months. Yes, it is a hot spot during race season with A.J.'s name attached but don't let that keep you away. It is also a terrific location for group or private events (max 200 people) and Foyt's can cater or outside catering is allowed!

Glasses of wine range from $5-$10 with flights (1 oz. pour) for $10. The menu consists of a limited selection of Appetizers (bacon wrapped jalapenos, hummus, chips and salsa), Salads (house or Caesar), Sandwiches (ham & cheese, Italian or Cuban Sando, or BLT, $11-$13) and Charcuterie ($23.99) and Cheese Boards ($18.99). The Charcuterie board includes three seasonal meats and your choice of three Tulip Tree Creamery cheeses (Haymaids. Trillium, Beer Cheese, Larkspur, Nettle, Snap Dragon or Fromaige Fras). Let's not forget dessert from 'Best Chocolate in Town' truffles (dark, lemon, cappuccino, hazelnut, amaretto for $3.25 each). You can even indulge in Foyt Wines and truffle pairings ($21).

Whether you're searching for a fun evening out maybe playing shuffle board, participating in a bridal shower, a rehearsal dinner, a board meeting or hosting a private event for your group, you'll see why this unique wine bar has become a staple for the locals and tourists.",helpful,1,0

1439,657855651a6d2c7052a63f05,"Yippie! I finally have eaten at all four of the local MTJ's. What I love about MTJ is the consistency. It doesn't matter which location I enjoy, the food, drinks and service are always top-notch. 

This visit to MTJ, I was introducing family members to one of my favorite taco haunts. We started out with chips and salsa and an order of guacamole. My sister loved the guac. I'm a fan of their chips and salsa. Some complain about having to pay for them, but you get what you pay for and that is quality freshly made salsa's and house made chips. Those free chips and salsa at other Mexican restaurants, cannot come close in comparison to these. 

Our drinks of choice were; for me a Mission Margarita, all those fresh ingredients go down so smoothly. My sister, not a fan of Marg's enjoyed a Vodka and Lemonade. She was pleased, they used Tito's, her favorite vodka. Steve her husband, had a Busch beer. All I can say about an A-B product is that it was a 16 oz can. 

Before ordering food, I educated my guest by showing them my pictures of everything I've eaten at MTJ. It was like a photo menu. Every item they asked about, I had eaten and had a picture to share. 

My sis wanted a Burrito. I kept telling her they were huge,and she still ordered the, South Beach. She has recently completed cancer treatments, so her appetite wasn't a big as her eyes. She ate only about a fourth of it and I got to bring the rest of it home for lunch the next day. We were both happy. Steve went with Empanadas and Carne Asada taco. He was impressed with the flavor and also that the order was 3 separate empanadas. 

I went with my usual order of three tacos. Baja Fish (fried), 
Mango-Hop-Anero Shrimp and a Habanero Chicken. My favorite has always been the Baja Fish, but today the Habanero Chicken stole my heart and may be my new favorite and go-to order. 

The service was personable and friendly. Just like it is at all the other MTJ's. Again, I repeat myself, I love the consistency of MTJ. 

If you love tacos and Margarita's, you gotta give any of the MTJ's a try. 

I'll be back? - May-be not St. Charles, but I'll be back to one closer to home.

When a couple of Portland Yelpers were in town for a visit, some friends organized a brunch in their honor. What better way to showcase Nola to some PDX folks than brunch in a dive bar? If that sounds a little funky to you, I felt the same way. Once I got over my penchant for fanciness and embraced the idea, I had one damn good brunch.

The way brunch works is you get a menu, mark down your order and turn it in to the bartender. I chose the pulled pork benedict with scrambled eggs and a side of hash browns. The hash browns are similar to McDonald's rectangular variety and tasted about the same. What made the brunch great was the pulled pork paired with scrambled eggs. For some reason those two things went very well together, but the pork was the star. I will definitely be back just to try some of their regular BBQ in the future.

If you are looking for a unique brunch experience, you have to try Shortall's.",helpful,1,0

Life definitely won't be the same anymore without their filet po-boys for lunch. I actually just celebrated my birthday here this year, and I'm so grateful that I did. 

It was a party of 8 and all of us were very pleased with our food. When we left, we all had full stomaches and empty plates. 

With that being said, since I heard about it closing down on Tues. (it's now Thurs.), my friends and I have been there twice already and will be going back tonight. When we went on Tues, the wait was over 2 hours long! So why are they closing????

Things I'll miss about this place:
- yatty hostesses and waitresses (so NOLA)
- filets with that garlic butter sauce (hoping they will bottle that so I can bathe in it)
- crazy potatoes (did someone say crazy good??)
- dipping bread (with that bomb-ass dipping sauce. what's in there? garlic, butter, their steak sauce, love?, crack??)
- bbq shrimp (will definitely give any seafood place a run for their money)
- sauteed mushrooms (what's better than meat and potatoes? meat, potatoes AND mushrooms. *my* holy trinity.)
- stuffed artichoke (meal in it of itself)
- homemade steak sauce (will prolly miss this the most *sobs*)
- quick service
- spending under $20 for steak and potatoes
- the memories

The finance department is the most incompetent and inconsiderate bunch I've ever done business with. They do not care one bit about the customer or their satisfaction. The finance manager I dealt with tried to take advantage of me and my wife by agressively selling us on their extra insurance/coverages (which they make commission off of). I told the guy I did not want any of it and he argued with me asking me why I didn't want it and would not take no for an answer. I told him no over and over again during the 5 HOURS it took for him to complete the paperwork. We get ready to sign a document AND HE ADDED IN THE EXTRA CRAP WE TOLD HIM WE DIDN'T WANT. The guy even apologized for how he treated us and the way he was acting when it was over. He knew he was acting out of place but he didn't care because all he saw in us was a young naive couple that he could make a nice commission off of. It's now 5 months later and we are STILL dealing with them because they added GAP insurance to our contract which we didnt want and told us we could remove it easily whenever we wanted. Fed up with this guy and wanting to leave we agreed to just call and get it removed later that week instead of redoing the contract. Turns out that was a lie. We have now paid the full insurance premium and are ""told"" we will get a refund. Oh and good luck trying to contact them and get them to do anything with any sense of urgency.

1472,657855641a6d2c7052a63502,"I went to a party with friends at Tower Theater last night. Awful time. I'm so upset and disappointed.

Security was ridiculous. Many of my friends who are of age and had valid IDs were refused drinks and/or kicked out of the party (not that they missed much). Those who weren't drinking were segregated from the rest of the guests; I couldn't see my date for most of the party. Guards would interrupt conversations and stop people dancing to check wristbands and IDs. Drinks were not allowed at dinner. At one point in the night when I was sick in the restroom, my date tried to enter the men's room to give me water and take care of me; she was forcibly stopped by security in case she was trying to share drinks with me. I understand that underage drinking is illegal, but Tower Theater should have explained to us the measures they would be taking to prevent it; instead, they deceived us into purchasing the open bar and did everything they could to stop people (including those of age!) from drinking, maximizing profit.

Not only was security ridiculously overzealous, but Tower Theater lied to us about many aspects of their services. The open bar was severely under-stocked and lacked the variety and quality we were promised; many basic bar essentials were missing including dark beer and bottled wine. Hors d'oeuvres were a small table of cheese, crackers, and ham; while underwhelming, this was the best food offered the entire night. However, it was quickly ushered away once ""dinner"" started. Tower Theater charged in-advance $80 per-plate for what turned out to be cafeteria-grade microwaved garbage. This included warm roast-beef coldcuts and reheated ""baked ziti"" that had definitely never seen an oven. There were no vegan options except a pile of mostly-raw broccoli and cauliflower. Guests had to serve themselves dinner on plastic plates with plastic utensils, which ran out well before everyone had taken food. Everything was inedible. And again, drinks were not allowed at dinner. Desert was all I had left to look forward to; our party planner assured us he purchased the catering package with cannolis for desert. Disappointingly, the cannolis were completely absent from the desert table. Instead, we were served macaroons and small cheesecake-like cylinders, many of which were different colors despite tasting identical. Clearly, we did not receive the food and drink we paid for.

Tower Theater advertised to us a theater space and a dance floor when we booked the venue. The former had its entrances hidden and blocked off; not a single guest made their way into the theater the entire night. The latter was not a ballroom or party space, but the theater lobby with a DJ booth wheeled in. The only reason there was room to dance was because security kicked out a quarter of our guests.

While it is one of my smaller complaints, its worth noting that there is no cell service in the entire building.

This was an awful night. We were ripped off, yelled at, exploited, segregated, and treated like children by Tower Theater. Don't ruin your event; hold it somewhere else.",helpful,1,0

I've taken my two dogs here one to two times a week over the past 6-7 months.  The building and property are very impressive (misting stations in the summer to keep the dogs cool is pretty cool) and generally very clean.  Customer service is inconsistent.  Boarding gate drop off is a very cool service which saves time, but picking up is normally a slow time consuming process, I've waited in excess of 15 minutes to pick up my dogs in the past, although an average is probably closer to 5 minutes.  The employees who pick up the dogs at the gates are generally pretty friendly, but front desk staff has one woman I've encountered who is pleasant, and the other 3 are not so much.  To be fair the woman who I normally see in the evening for pick up is the pleasant one.  While the facilities are very nice to look at I've found out that if it is raining and there is a training happening inside, your dog(s) will be out in the rain, literally.  When I dropped off one day during rain I was told there was training that day and my dogs would be rotated inside as much as possible, but they would spend most of the time outside, in the rain.  Outside of rainy days, my dogs still come back noticeably dirtier than when I dropped them off, I'm not exactly sure how this happens. If you want to use their doggy day care they ask that you call in advance to help with staffing, which is understandable but no one else asks for this.  Grooming is good, but there is no furminate option and the equivalent offered is nowhere near as good at removing hair.

They'll take requests from 60's - 90's.  AND they let you bring your headphones and listening devises for music onto the rink which is very cool.  I know some rinks that won't take requests AND refuses to allow you onto the rink with an iphone.

This place had maybe 75-90 people there the whole night.  A Friday night wasn't too crowded AT ALL.  My mom had a ball and didn't get discouraged after her first fall.  And my mom loves skating.  She's 68.  

Now for some advice.  The referees skating around need to be more proactive in helping older skaters up off the floor if they just see them sitting there.  Common sense would tell me if a woman just stays on the floor sitting means she can't get up on her own strength.  The referees were not helpful.  They need to be more aware of what's going on.  There were also kids coming onto the rink with toys in their hands that fell onto the rink floor a couple of times which could have been a hazard but am glad that didn't cause someone to fall.  Also some kids were literally running/skating onto the floor from the sides, completely disregarding the skaters already skating in a path around the rink.  Those kids should have been told to come onto the rink not at a running pace.

If there's an improvement to be made in the future, railings around the rink to help younger, older, and beginner skaters would be very great so they have something to pull themselves up with(since the referees don't do anything).",helpful,1,0

This is the first place I've ever wanted to walk out of before the first visit was over.  I told the doctor exactly what my issues were and I knew exactly what type of treatment I needed.  I completely understand that each doctor wants to do their own evaluation to determine the best treatment, but I've never experienced a chiropractic office that felt like I was in a used car showroom.  The first visit was insurance verification (which I understand) and then 30 minutes in a room with a physical therapist asking me questions and perform flex tests and foot measurements....again...whatever.  45 minutes later I asked when I could get my adjustment and I was told that happens on the second visit.  Ugh!!  Ok so I scheduled my second visit.  Upon arrival and check in I was quickly ushered into an office where the doctor starting talking at me, rather than to me.  He embarked upon a scripted presentation of all of the services they offer and the recommended treatments and would not come up for air.  He then tried to sell me a pre-paid package of treatments over a span of 6 months.  When I told him I was just in town for 8 weeks, he seemed confused and started stumbling over his words.  I suggested that we just take it a week at a time and charge me as I visit.  He stated that they ""aren't set up for one-time-visit-payments (huh?) and that they couldn't help me.  I literally had to talk him into giving me one adjustment that day and he did so begrudgingly.  In the end, I would never recommend this facility to anyone.",helpful,1,0

1520,657855651a6d2c7052a63f0f,"Let me tell you the story of Hilary Duff the Boba Nazi and Saint Louis Bubble Tea.

Today, my lunch + fun = funch work crew planned on going to Pita + and the Saint Louis Bubble Tea house for dessert. They are both next door to each other on Olive, so our plan was a good one.

The adventure started out poorly, as we decided to go to Saint Louis Rotisserie in place of Pita +, but that experience will be reviewed elsewhere.

So we walk into bubble tea, simultaneously overcome by the billboard sized 25 foot tall wall menu and our anticipation for our first bubble treats. Too bad our fantasy was destroyed by Hilary Duff the Boba Nazi.

Eyes shining with delight, we asked her what the quintessential boba tea was, which was the tastiest, and which one she would like best herself.  We laughed, we batted our eyes, we threw down the wide eyed doey curiosity so thick Hitler himself would have caved in. But not Hilary Duff the Boba Nazi. 

HDTBN was all business, no bubbles. She answered our questions as though the SS were demanding a field report from their top commander. I don't think someone could have explained Bubble Snow any colder than HDTBN.
 
But on this day, our bubble fever was too high for Hilary Duff the Boba Nazi. We couldn't be cooled down by her icy demeanor. Oh, HDTBN was hard to beat. She raged over the boba tea machines, sputtering them to speeds so fast, they screamed like Nazi camps come back from hell. In the end, she was no match for us.
 
Gallantly, we raised our two mango boba snows and one chocolate pudding boba tea with joy, and were resplendent in our victory. The mango boba snows were like super happy hello kitties in a cup. I will go back to this bubble tea shop. HDTBN wouldn't let me take pictures of the menu because she said that competition in the STL area was high, and that enemies of the state of bubble have tried to uncover their secrets, posing as phototaking customers.  I don't blame her on this tactical operation, as you can tell this shop was probably the first of its kind in the area, before bubble tea got all hip to the squares.
 
This story would not be complete if I did not mention the one causality that our bubble dreams suffered. In perhaps the final and most crucial move on the part of Hilary Duff the Boba Nazi, she did not warn us against ordering the chocolate pudding boba tea. In fact, she gave no warning signs at all. To our dismay, the chocolate pudding boba tea was like drinking a hobo's placenta through a straw. I imagine that HDTBN, and fellow co worker, the jazz I smell excrement bass player, kept shop the rest of the day, knowingly smirking at each other over their bubble secrets, surely aware of the detonation they planted among us.",helpful,1,0

But when I need a sundry item beyond what the Neighborhood Market carries and it's after closing time for Target or some other place I can procure the item, I usually end up here. I could walk here if I really wanted to, but I choose to stay far, far away unless I really need something. Other reviewers have well documented the safety issues here; while they do employ a roving unarmed security guard in a subcompact that's equipped with a radio, I don't let my wife come here without me, even in broad daylight. 

I've had numerous run-in's with bad staff at the return counter, enough that I usually don't even bother trying to return an item purchased there anymore unless it's worth a few hours of my time between the phone calls and the store visits. Once, I had to return a car battery I purchased there that completely discharged in a month of normal use. I made the mistake of purchasing a replacement battery prior to visiting the return counter with the bad one. The clerk just couldn't comprehend how to provide the warranty, and called her supervisor, who told me that it ""must be the manufacturer"". Upon calling the manufacturer, they told me that no, Walmart was indeed the contact for any warranty replacement, and wished me luck in my struggle, apparently this ""misunderstanding"" happens quite a lot. Thankfully, I was able to get the store manager on the phone and he told me that they would ""take care of me"". The supervisor who previously had sent me on my fool's errand to the manufacturer came to the return counter and approved a Walmart store credit card in the amount of my purchase.

With a perfectly timed wait  to enjoy our drinks, our table was greeted with a pound of mussels & frites and tuna tartare.  The fresh garlicly butter sauce steamed the black mussels well.  The small mussels are the best, so I'm glad they went with these versus green mussels.  The sauce was divine along with the crispiest French loaf.  The loaf was super soft in the middle and had the perfect crackle on the outside.  How they made the bread, who knows! But this is a multi- star appetizer.  To me, this appetizer would be a great afternoon dish to have solo or to share with an entire bottle of wine.  This was such a great appetizer.  The tuna tartare, was well presented on the platter.  The sliced radishes and grape tomatoes make the dish look sparkly.  I think the cucumbers were a bit too large; but the introduction of the pickled carrots and spring onions made up for it.  In terms appetizers, the mussels are golden!
As our white Bordeaux wine was being served, we were provided our entrees.  I had the Scallops with Peas and Carrots.  My wife had the Pan Seared Halibut.  If you had a lot of mussels and wine, the scallops are the way to go as the portion is not overwhelming.  The buttery crisp of the scallops were nicely seared.  It had perfect color, bite and texture.  The huge surprise was the pickled mustard seeds, which to me looked like tobiko.  I think these mustard seeds were amazing.  The artistic plate design was created with two swoops, one each of pea puree and the carrot puree.  Take a moment to observe and  admire the craftsmanship.  The Pan Seared Halibut was a hearty meal.  I like halibut and the crisp sear and steamy flesh was flawlessly prepared.  The bed maque choux wasn't the typical Louisiana style maque choux I'm used to making; but the addition of edamame into it and less cream was delicious.

The place is super stylish which made me a bit wary, since I usually like my pho from dives at the back of shady strip centers. I came for lunch on a Wednesday.  I walked up to the counter to order since it looked like The Thing To Do, but the woman at the counter said if I was eating in I'd need to wait for someone to seat me.

Finally I was seated and from then on, my every need was met.

The pho is legit, y'all.  I ordered the Pho Ga (or ""Pho Chicken"" as it says on the menu) and asked if they'd add some tofu to it, because if you haven't dunked broth-soaked tofu chunks into sriracha you haven't truly lived, friend.

The bowl comes out, and it's slightly smaller than the humongous bowls I'm used to, but it's in the ballpark.  All the standard fixins are there; bean sprouts, lime, jalapeno, cilantro, basil. Looking good. Hoisin & sriracha are already on the table with chopsticks, napkins, silverware, soup spoon, etc.  The broth is pretty darn good, not super greasy like other places I've tried here, and not too salty.  The chicken & tofu were pretty and high quality. The wait staff were around frequently to make sure my water glass was full, asking if I needed anything, etc.

1544,657855651a6d2c7052a640cb,"Update time! Twisted Fork is still one of my favorites and I still feel like sometimes it's a secret spot that only a few of us know about. 

This was my pick for my birthday dinner again (my last review was for a birthday dinner too). It was just 2 of us this time and even though we had reservations, there were plenty of open tables (it was a Monday night after all). 

We ordered the queso fundido and the short rib aprea appetizers. Loved every bite of the short rib aprea. I could eat a couple of these as a meal and be totally continent. We added chorizo to queso fundido and we loved it too, but it was a lot for just 2 people to try and share, I'd recommend it for bigger groups. 

I ordered the pork shoulder as my entree. This is a huge piece of pork, but unfortunately was a little overcooked. The succotash is a nice contrast to the pork. I ended up taking a majority of this home and was able to split the pork into 3 more meals. My boyfriend's entree was the parmesan chicken. This was really good and bonus points for serving it over ravioli! I'd for sure order that next time.

Somewhere during the night, my boyfriend let our waitress know it was my birthday. Luckily they don't sing, but she did bring me out a huge, fudgy brownie (one of my favorite desserts!)

1557,657855651a6d2c7052a64575,"I guess I'll be that person that breaks the 5 star trend. I remember going to Live on the Green when it first started and it was amazing. Being able to just sit and relax while listening to music was awesome. Now, not so much. I fear, dear Nashville, this event has outgrown its tiny space. I went mainly to see City & Colour and while I'm glad I toughed it out to the end, it was not pleasurable for the most part.

At first, yes many people were lounging on blankets and enjoying the opening band but as the night progressed it got considerably more crowded. Those with blankets and lawn chairs seemed to just give up after awhile and retreat to other places or leave all together. We were CONSTANTLY being pushed or bombarded with ""excuse me I need to get by"" as people walked over others to stand towards the front. Soon it was no longer a fun, live show but instead of was the dodging of the beer and cigarette smoke as people moved around you, most with no sympathy to your presence whatsoever. 

Lots of great local food trucks, companies and beer vendors but getting to these stands were a gamble of either losing your spot on the lawn (if lucky enough to have one) or braving sending one or two of your party to navigate through the crowd. The lines were outrageous, mainly just groups of people standing in whatever fashion they deemed fit. While, from what I saw, prices were quite reasonable for a ""concert"" event, the lines just weren't worth it.

Most of the artists that play this event are not the ""lets all dance and move to the beat"" kind of artists, at least on this night. City & Colour is a perfect example of the type of music this event was made for! It would have been awesome to just sit and be able to listen to the heavenly vocals of Dallas Green while enjoying a beer but instead you have to settle for listening to the music while filtering out every single social hour conversation going on around you. If you just want to hear the music and don't care about actually being able to see the artist, then find a spot a good distance away and you'll be fine. 

I feel like this event could be amazing, if run more efficiently. Possibly moving the beer tents and such away from the stage vicinity would help thin out the crowd of those patrons that make you think ""are they waiting in line or just watching the show?"" Before you go, ask yourself this: Do I want to be constantly stepped around, over or pushed aside by what seems to be every single person who has crawled out of East Nashville's hipster woodworks? Do I enjoy having my feet stepped on, beer spilled on my shoe and cigarette smoke being blown in my direction by countless people with no decency for those around me? Do I want to see great artists for free but sacrifice my comfort as I stand for 5+ hours? If so, then this is the event for you! I appreciate the fact it's a free show and I guess this is what you should expect with a show like this but guys, this isn't Bonnaroo. You do not have days to spend socializing and getting messed up as you listen to the music. It's a concert full of regular people who may or may not enjoy the fact you are plastered on a local pale ale as you smoke your billionth cigarette of the night. Most of us just wanted to be able to enjoy a great night of music but, at least in my opinion, this time it fell very short.",helpful,1,0

We had a group of 12 girls; originally when I made the reservation, they told me it would be a tight squeeze (which we were fine with). Also - I made the reservation about a month prior, and they only had one time available for our group size. 

When we arrived at the restaurant, they escorted us upstairs to the chef's private room. It overlooked the main kitchen through the glass windows, and the TV screens on the sides of the room overlooked the smaller kitchen. It was beyond what we had expected and we were all pleasantly surprised! :) 

A majority of the girls in the group were vegetarian, and this was one of the few fancy restaurants in NOLA that had more than one vegetarian option. We ordered the burrata salad, roasted baby beets salad, they made a vegetarian risotto and Charred Eggplant Lasagnette . For sides, we ordered the Grilled Asparagus and the truffle mashed potatoes. My favorite was the truffle mashed potatoes...so so good! A little too much black pepper for my taste, but regardless we all devoured it. The burrata salad was standard; the risotto and lasagnette were also delicious!! :) Some of the girls shared the Fire Roasted Oysters, which is a specialty in NOLA, and they also loved it!

From the time this spot first opened to now, it's like a totally different restaurant. I waited to write this review for a while. The owners heard lots of feedback in the beginning, obviously took it to heart and that turned into the restaurant they are today.

I've enjoyed takeout from CHAR-B-QUE on numerous occasions. When their game is on, the food is awesome. Barky tender brisket, smokey dry rub ribs, and crispy rotisserie chickens served with a massive array of freshly made sides.

Today I lucked out. It's National BBQ month and it was ""Spare Rib Day"" so my 3 bone plate came with four! For sides i went with Southern Slaw and smoky pinto bean, and added 4 oz of brisket, about 3 good slices, to accompany the ribs. 

The ribs are the deeply smoky, dry rubbed style, not quite falling off the bone, offering some tender meatiness. Normally I'm a dry rub purist, but I think the rub is light on salt or something, so I add a thin coat of their house bbq sauce! It's not super sweet, it's got a great level of tang, and a hit of spice. If you like sauce hotter, they have a spicy version which is nice too! 

Now the brisket is the star, when it's in top form. This can be damn near competition level at times, but unfortunately I have not found it there consistently. Even when it's not though, its moist, well flavored, and perfect topped with a little slaw, sauce and wrapped in a tortilla (served with the meat plates!). 

I've never tried one, but I love that they offer daily specials and a rotation of house made sausages. The options here are endless, which is why this has become a South Reno favorite for me. Quick for lunch, great for take out, and delicious for dinner. Add it to your rotation.",helpful,1,0
1574,657855651a6d2c7052a643ba,"The best cheesesteak in Philly. This place hits every element out of the park. Steak is tasty, cheese is sharp, and the bread is surprisingly the star of the show.

A few quick notes, Angelo's is cash only, but they do have an ATM inside. When I went on a Friday afternoon, the place was absolutely packed; they did manage to get our food out to us quickly. A few tables outside the store, and some standing room inside the store to eat, but expect it to be jammed. The girl taking our orders was very friendly, and helpful, recommending I get Cooper Sharp, over American Cheese, which turned out to be the right suggestion. 

The cheesesteak with onions and Cooper Sharp cheese is the way to go. Let's start with the surprising star of the cheesesteak, the bread. We're talking about an Italian roll freshly baked in-house. It's seeded, fresh, and used perfectly. Probably the most overlooked element to any cheesesteak, Angelo's nails it. You get this perfect crunch with every bite, and I cannot even begin to tell you how good a fresh baked Italian roll is. To talk about the cheese, go with the Cooper Sharp. It's basically a sharper American, and having tasted them both side by side, the Cooper Sharp adds the perfect balance of flavor. The steak it good quality, cut into ribbons, but not really chopped up too much. I will say, the only real knock on the cheesesteak is I wish there was a tiny more steak on the sandwich, as I did get a few bites with just bread (not that I'm complaining, but is wonderful). The meat is very tasty, and more ribboned, not chopped finely. Also, when you get onions here, you can taste them. Not finely chopped, so you really get the crunch of the onion. In terms of competitors, I think John's Roast Pork cheesesteak is close to it, but the fresh Italian roll, and Cooper Sharp cheese puts this over the edge.

I also had cheese fries while I was here, honestly, they were whatever. Just average, out of a bag fries with some cheese wiz on them. Not that there is anything wrong with that, it's a classic, but nothing special about the cheese fries. Price is $11 for a cheesesteak, which I think is a bit on the higher end for Philly cheesesteaks, but totally worth it.

I had a Groupon for $200 towards a pair of prescription glasses.  I went in one evening to check out the selection.  The lady who ""greeted"" me wasn't overly friendly.  I told her I was browsing for frames and she told me to give her my prescription (told, not asked).  I gave her the latest one I had, which was from a few years prior.  She snorted at me and said it was too old and I'd have to get another exam done.  I asked why, because I honestly didn't know that was against the rules, and instead of just telling me why, she made me feel like an idiot by laughing at me and yelling across the store to the optometrist, telling him to explain why.  I told her to forget it and left..but I HAD already paid for the Groupon so I ended up returning to the store a few weeks later after going ELSEWHERE to get an eye exam and recent prescription.

This time the lady helping me was quite friendly and sweet and I managed to find a nice pair of frames (which ended up costing me over $400 even with the $200 Groupon!!).  They had them ready for me in a few days but their hours are so stupid that I had to take time off work to get down there to pick them up.

When I tried them on, I noticed that everything looked a bit off and told the optometrist I thought they needed to be adjusted.  ""No, your eyes just have to get used to them"".  I took his word for it and left, figuring I'd give it a few days.  

After 2 days, I couldn't handle the headaches anymore so I went back, once again having to take time off work to make it there before their ""lab"" closed.  The optometrist looked at my glasses and agreed they needed to be adjusted.  When he gave them back to me, the lenses had bubbled and cracked and it was like I was looking through a rain-covered window.  He didn't even NOTICE there was something wrong with them!!  I made them reorder the lenses on a rush and this time I told them I was NOT taking any more time off work.  They said they could deliver them to me at work and said there would ""be no adjustments necessary"".

One look at the menu you realize Shaker and Peel offers Mexican inspired items and top-notch tasty and balanced cocktails. The dishes vary from sharables to salads to taco to wok to desert.  

The Queso fun-dido is a cheesy goodness with a slight body and bite due to two types of cheese and homemade chorizo poblano vinaigrette while served with corn chips -- this one is addictive. Good luck stopping until every drop of queso is scraped clean. 

The Tacos are street taco size and are priced per taco. At time of this review, there are 14 different taco are offered with chicken, pork, steak, fish, shrimp, and non-meat option. There are non-spicy options but majority of items have a kick to them. I was pleasantly surprised by the slight kick to my Grilled Fish taco. The Angry Pig true to its menu description is pretty spicy. General Tso's Cauliflower taco is a vegetarian option that has balanced of crunch, and flavor. The peanuts add a surprising heft to this taco. Short Rib taco is one of the milder flavored taco the added manchego adds a creamy finish to each bite of this taco. 

For the cocktails That's What I Mint is a light but flavorfully boozy drink with an fluffy cream topper. The drink is low on the sweet side, which brings out its flavors. They also offer some in-house flavor infused tequila as well. 

The ambiance of shaker and peel is that of a rustic yet modern casual eatery. There are plenty of tv mounted to catch the game, the noise level is that of a hopping eatery. Seating can be had at the bar, high tops, booth, and usual height tables along the far wall  the service is attentive and very helpful as you navigate the menu as well as any questions you might have. Food is served pretty quickly upon preferring however I'm sure this will vary based on the level of crowd. My visit was after the lunch crowd on a Saturday afternoon.

It started with the person at the register not knowing how to ring up an order.  I told him i was using a reward, showed him phone that showed the reward, and ordered a venti peppermint mocha with 3 shots.  After a number of confusing and voided transactions.  He then charged my card $7.94.  I told him - ""no, remember? I am using a reward, why did it charge my card?""  He then gets the manager to reload $7.62 back on my card. I told him ""no - you charged me $7.92, and that's not even the regular price for these - it should be close to $9""  I asked where are the receipts - he only shows me the $7.62 ring up.  I told him i know it was $7.92, but he rings it up and it's $7.62.  I told him again show me the original receipt you charged me 7.92.  He doesn't have it.  I couldn't pull it up on my phone yet.  Sure enough, now that i look, - there it is - a reload of $7.62, and a charge of $7.92.   

Then the manager said  nevermind the drink is on us.  My reward is gone; I did not get all of my money back, and THEN when i get my order (already made and starting to separate, he pours it into a Grande.  I said that was supposed to be a Venti peppermint mocha with 3 shots.  He then goes to the blender and pours the bottom remainings into a Venti cup and adds the rest and gives it to me.  .  Never mind the drink tasted more half liquid icey water than peppermint, mocha, or espresso!!!  I was so frustrated i didn't want to start all over again as i was in there for 20 minutes.

The result was me cooking at home for some time after our visit. The first thing was the smell of the restaurant. The entire place smelled of mold, which is scary. I even asked my husband if we could leave, but he didn't want to be rude. They sat us, and my next clue that it was a mistake to be there was it was completely empty. We were the only customers in the restaurant, and it was six pm on a Friday evening, typically prime time for any restaurant. They first thing to come was our drinks, and we both got water. There was no ice and the water was actually warm, not room temp., like it came from a sink. I asked for ice in my water, and the waiter took my glass and proceeded to come back empty handed to take our orders. I ordered a burger and fries, and a cup of New England clam chowder as a starter. My husband ordered  rare steak and mashed potatoes. When my clam chowder came, it was clear manhattan chowder (tomato based) and not what I wanted. So I left it untouched to wait for my food. I then sat their and watched my waiter text and play games on his phone with another waitress for nearly an hour, and not once did he check on us or the food. Then, he looked at me, clearly remembering I existed, and went to get our order. When the food arrived, I became very irritated. The food was cold, because he had forgotten about it. My burger was burnt, and my fries we bland and freezing. My husband's steak was far from rare, in fact nearly burnt too, and his mashed potatoes were clearly the boxed kind and also freezing. On top of it all,we still had no iced water. When I got the bill I was appalled at the prices. It was nearly $70 for our food.

To begin, I went into the salon with just-past-shoulders ""auburn"" (more appropriately, just badly-faded brassy blonde) hair.

Ashley foiled my hair precisely and very carefully, being sure that she was working color in around my face and keeping the color natural.  It turned out beautifully - the brass is GONE and has been replaced with a beigey, glowing blonde.

Lucas spent a good hour snipping my fine hair - not something anyone has done before.  He was so detailed, and the precision of the cut was exceptional.  My hair swings around, I can style it in tons of different ways - and it's a basic, shoulder-length layered cut.

At $13 for a 16"" pie (which is considered a medium there, but I'd call it a large) delivered (or $11.50 without delivery) it's also super affordable. Thank you Lazaros, for almost (but definitely not quite) making me feel like I'm home.",unhelpful,0,1

Marilyn's Fried Chicken (3.5/5): Was a little disappointed with the chicken- it was kind of served in one huge ball that was hard to pick apart. my main complaint was that it was super dry and a lot of it was breading; from the color of the outside it might've been a bit overcooked?

I got so excited I had to visit so we decided to walk down and get a midday snack. The decorations and interior were 100% on point. We waited a few minutes for our table to get ready and checked out the black light waiting area. There was mad max gear, armor, furniture and even a car seat from one of the crazy cars haha.

We were seated next to the open kitchen which was pretty cool. Even the chefs were dressed up in working costume gear. A nice waitress came over and gave us all the deets regarding the menu and also mentioned that there was a VR room where we can play and pay by the minute. We decided to go for it since me and another friend in the group were visiting philly. The VR was pretty mediocre. There was a menu list of different shows and games we could choose from. I saw blade runner and I had to pick it. IMO if you've tried VRs before, there's really no need to pay to try it here. I'd rather spend an extra few bucks on another drink/food.

We each ordered a drink and got one entree and appetizer to share. The drinks first of all were really good. I don't quite remember the name of my drink but it had gin and elderflower liquor and I loved it. Then we ordered grilled chicken on Himalayan salt rock and lamb kebab fries. Both were quite nice. The food was way better than I'd expect since usually they aren't too great at themed restaurants but this spot was thumbs up.

1636,657855651a6d2c7052a63558,"Hands down worst experience I have ever had with a manicure and pedicure. I first walked in and a very nice woman sent me in a wooden ""Massage"" chair. The tub that you put your feet in was set in a wooden base with a cheap plastic container like it tub. If I were to make my legs and feet comfortable I would have knocked the wooden base out of the massage chair. By the way, the ""massage"" of the chair was different levels of vibration.I feel like they bought this chair accidentally from a sex shop and thought maybe they could get away with saying it was a massage chair. I had to turn it off at one point because the vibrations were so more uncomfortable than they were relaxing. Moving onto the pedicure, the nail file that was used dug into my toes and cut underneath my big toenails. The massage was OK but then it came time to paint my toes. At that point I realized this woman has absolutely no idea what she is doing. My two-year-old niece could paint my toenails better than this woman could. She got way more nail polish on my actual skin that she did on my toenails. I didn't realize until I was getting my manicure done how terrible it looked. Onto the manicure, the girl who did my nails had such a nasty look on her face the whole time. My chair couldn't fit under the work station so I had to lower it so my knees wouldn't hit the table. At that point I was so low that putting my hands onto the table had my shoulders to my ears. So uncomfortable! It seemed like this was this girls first manicure. She didn't get all of the polish off my nails to start. Then used a very coarse nail file to file my nails leaving them jagged and rough. Same as the woman before, she missed huge places on my nails while painting them getting just as much polish on my skin and she did on my nails. I had to tell her 3 times that she missed spots on my nails then asked me how they looked. I told her there was polish on my cuticles for 4 of my nails. After she ""fixed"" them, she put a tiny and extremely dusty fan in front of me to blow on my nails. I barely waited for them to be dry before bolting out of there. Before this entires experience, I had also wanted to do a lip and eyebrow waxed. While sitting for my manicure and evaluating the entire establishment, I noticed a crockpot sitting on the floor. After getting up to wash my hands off in the bathroom, I noticed that is where the wax was being stored. I changed my mind very quickly after that.

There are a bunch of people who don't appreciate how amazing this unassuming and underrated Grill inside Reading Terminal Market is. As far as I'm concerned, they're all mothersmuckers. But you can't let them affect you. Don't let the smuckers get you down.

If you already knew about this place before I posted this review, wipe that Smuck look off your face. Maybe this smucking review is for others less fortunate than yourself, you farmy smucker. Oh wait, I meant, you smarmy...

Philadelphia is certainly the city with the greatest smucking sandwiches in the country overall. And that is not including cheesesteaks - because I don't rate them very highly and neither do a lot of the locals. Forget what all the tourist smuckers come and eat. They can smuck right off. If you come to Philly and eat cheesesteaks, it's about as clever as going to NYC to eat McDonald's and a smucking Nathan's hot dog. OK then.

But the pork and beef sandwiches of Philly are smucking incomparable. One of the very best - and I mean right up there in the top five or even top three in the region - is this little unheralded Amish Joint inside the Reading Terminal Market. Those Amish have a rep for being a distant and aloof bunch of smuckers, but the ones working here are smucking nice.

The breakfast sandwiches here are good, but the star of the show - by far - is the Pot Roast Sandwich. It's one of the best things I've ever smucking tasted. Ignore those smuckers and their smucking reviews about getting breakfast sandwiches here. What the smuck?

Make sure you get your Pot Roast with horseradish on it. Expect it to be wet and juicy and full of gravy, like a good, long, wet, juicy smuck with someone really smucking sexy. Expect it to fill you up completely, again like a good smuck. You can easily split it two ways and still feel smucking full. I can't describe how good this pot roast sandwich is, but what I can say is that every person I've sent here to try it has smucking fallen in love. So it's just a question of you smuckers trusting me and trying it. 

Other sandwiches in town you have to try are the roast pork from John's and the roast beef from Nick's old roast beef.

But back to Smuckers, smuckers. That beef is incomparable, much like the roast beef at Hartville Kitchen. ""The beef is incomparable"" he says, before comparing it to something in the same smucking sentence.

Way to get that English degree at Oxford, Fox.

The market itself is a must visit when coming to Philadelphia, for tourists and business people alike. It has a little of everything. Miller's twist has the best pretzels and lemonade imaginable. Tommy Dinic's has pretty good pork with broccoli rabe. But when you come to this Market do not whatever you do miss the pot roast sandwich at Smuckers. Ignore all the smuckers that tell you not to come here. They're just a bunch of ignorant mothersmuckers.

Both dishes were great and we couldn't decide which we liked more. We switched back & forth a few times.  
There was more food in the bibimbap and it saves better for leftovers; whereas with the soup we dumped all the rice that comes with it in right away which probably wouldn't have saved well. In the future, we'd add rice slowly dipping in a bite or two at a time.

Thank you for responding to my review. Why would I look on social media or any other place when the reservation was booked over a month ago and I spoke directly to one of your staff members over the phone?

Another addendum, you can't apologize and then try to say ""we felt our staff acted accordingly"" and ""I'm not sure how else we could have handled the situation.""  By saying these things, your taking no blame for your actions and telling me you have done no wrong.

1676,657855651a6d2c7052a643d3,"I am writing this review with the hope that the restaurant, because it doesn't feel like a brewery yet, listens to this feedback, because I want to see them succeed and serve as the ANCHOR business for West Belleville. 

1. If you want to be a Brewing Company, then you need to make that the focus of your brand. As it currently operates, it feels much more like a restaurant. Give people beer menus while they wait, give out beer samples while people wait. Do something to get the patrons thinking beer first, food second. The interior of the place is nicely decorated but does not feel like a brewery. Looking at the building from the outside is great, but the inside feels like a buffet. 
2. From what I've seen on my visits, most of the servers are really friendly but not beer knowledgeable. I understand that they are still working out the kinks from opening, but the servers need more training on the intricacies and differences between beers. This will enhance the brand! Teach then the Beer Basics first, tell the patrons that that's what you're doing, and add the nuances as you go...
3. Beer flights should be arranged from light to dark and encourage customers to drink it that way.
4. SOLID tasting beers. Keep up the good work there! I wish they had their chocolate stout when I went there, but they were out of it. No big deal. 
5. I live in St. Louis and have never heard of a $20 Growler refill. I have bought growlers throughout the country and have never heard of a $20 Growler refill. Follow The Civil Life's Brewery in St. Louis and knock that price down to $10. Also, we were told that growler refills would be $12, and when we returned they were all of a sudden $20. Either somebody needs to study behavioral economics and pricing or the server missed the boat on pricing...$26 for a new Growler with beer is way, way too pricey, especially for Belleville. 
6. The fried green tomatoes were quite good. I lived in Texas, and this dish is a staple there, and I thought they did a pretty good job with this. 
7. You can't allow people to sit outside with deafening construction going on. Don't give them the option; just say, ""We apologize that the outside is closed while we make the nicest beer garden in the Metro East. Please be patient with us."" My ears are still ringing... 

Again, I will return and I hope they make some changes, because West Belleville NEEDS this place to do well. Happy Drinking.",helpful,1,0

After having terrible experiences at another bike shop in the area... I stopped by kayuh, which was actually closer to me, while I lived by temple university.

The service is so friendly! They are honest about the work they're doing, quick, and inexpensive. 
The first time stopped by they replaced some small screws on my front rim that fell off (after having work done at Fairmount bikes...). They did it for free and it took about a minute.
The second time I used their services my back wheel had been stolen and i needed to replace it. They gave me the option of getting a new wheel or having a used one put on. At first Izzat didn't see a used wheel, but he looked again and found one! I was so happy that he gave me an option, and that he actually put effort into looking for a used one to help me out. He changed the wheel SO FAST. I literally just waited in the shop while the work was done.

The fact that they don't have a bunch of fancy shiny expensive bikes and parts in their shop doesn't bother me. That's not what I go to a shop for anyways. I go for friendly, quick, efficient service, and that's exactly what I got here.

Unfortunately I now live on the other side of Philly so it's not convenient for me to get there at all. But if your within a few block radius I highly recommend Kayuh bicycles.

When we first got in I decided to buy some of the pressed juice they have at the front. When I tried it, the texture was thick and chalky and way too sweet. My sister decided to buy the same exact juice, which was a completely different color, texture, and tasted much better than the one I got. When asked about it, was told they were just different batches. Shouldn't they at least taste the same? 

When it came around time to order, my boyfriend and I both decided on getting the heirloom tomato spaghetti, which we were told they were out of. The waitress says she will come back so we can decide on something else to get. I decide to get the mushroom tortellini and my boyfriend decides to get the lasagna. The waitress comes back and when I tell her what I want, lo and behold they're out of that too! We ask her if there's anything else they're out of and it includes the lasagna as well. 

*3 out of the 5 pasta dishes they have on the menu were completely out and the waitress didn't think to mention that to us before ordering?*

How do you run out of 3+ dishes when the restaurant is basically empty. We asked how long it would take to make these dishes and were told it would be 2 hours so I just decide on getting the bolognese. My cousin decided to get an appetizer along with her meal, and that was brought out with the rest of the food. Shouldn't the appetizer come before the meal? When the bolognese came, the homemade pasta was way too doughy and the sauce was nothing special. In my opinion, I'd 100% skip out on this place for dinner.",unhelpful,0,1

The man and I went to meet my mother and her fiancée at this little gem right in the heart of Lansdale at their insistence and I am so glad that we did! To preface the review, the man and I were in Greece a few months ago and one of our favorite aspects of our Grecian experience was the food so we came with some pretty high expectations. That being said, they were not only met, but exceeded. True to our experience in Greece, the service was outstanding - genuinely warm and congenial. Emily was our server and she was just so very awesome. Luckily for you, she seems to be there the majority of the time. Now on to the food...

We started with the gigantes hot app and the Greek salad. I had never had (or heard of) gigantes but basically they are oversized beans in a red sauce. Sounds so simple but I can't possibly overstate just how delicious they were! If you are a lover of legumes, do NOT pass these up. The salad was also very good and it was chopped, which I definitely appreciate. Nothing more annoying than lettuce chunks hanging out of your mouth like a ravenous iguana in public. But I digress...

We ordered waaaaay more food than was necessary for 4 people to share. But that's what I do because when it comes to decision time and there's so many scrumptious options in front of me, I err on the side of gluttony and order them all. Who doesn't like leftovers anyway? 

We shared the mousaka, two gyros, stuffed  tomatoes, pastitsio, spanakopita and the beefteki stuffed with cheese. OH. EMM. GEE. Soooo freaking good, everything!

To make an appointment: I called and left a message on two different days. I never got a call back. I went online and saw you can make an appointment online (requires a credit card to do this which I have experienced before with salons) so I made the appointment, got a confirmation of ""request"" email... and then ... crickets! At 10:30PM the night before the appointment, someone called me and told me their were no appointments and she could make something for the following week. so I made the appointment via phone. At 11:15PM I got another call from the salon to make an appointment. It was serious confusion and rude to call so late, but I brushed it off.

I got to my appointment 10 minutes early and there was no one there. The salon is nice and clean looking so I sat down in the lobby area. I wasn't sure how long I should wait, so I waited until my appointment time when someone finally came out from the back. She called someone on the phone and told them I was there and then told me her masseuse was having dinner and would be right back. No big deal, I mean these people have lives too. She finally arrived and took me back told me to undress to my comfort level and she would be right back. I looked at my watch and it was 6:20 and the massage still hadn't started. A few minutes later, she came in... not very friendly, but I'm not there to be her friend I just wanted a massage. 

An ""OK"" massage followed, I have had better. I felt like she took a lot of breaks between each area, at one point I wasn't sure if she was still in the room. Finally, she finished and left the room. I looked at my watch and it was 7:04. So the 60 minute Swedish massage is actually around 40 minutes of actual massage. 

When she left, she said that she was going to have water waiting for me in the lobby. I was irritated about the time of the massage but thought I should still tip 20%. I got dressed and walked out to the lobby and again there was no one there.. no employees... no customers... no people... nothing.. there was a glass of water on top of the cooler, I assume that was for me but I really didn't even want to drink it not knowing if it was even a clean glass.  I left a 10% tip on the counter and left. Then I see her peeling off in her SUV from the parking lot. Customer service is lost on this place.. a spa day isn't supposed to be stressful.

1720,657855641a6d2c7052a6346f,"I'm adjusting this review. I started with a 3 star rating, which Yelp defines as ""A-OK"", but after letting my skin rest for a week, I'm now to a 2 star if not one star.

I visited Woodhouse for a facial. Unlike other reviewers, I was greeted warmly and shown to the relaxation area and women's changing room. The experience reminded me of the Escape Day Spa in Nashville, but on a smaller scale and lacking the polish. Something about the process seemed awkward and the spa is nice, but in need of an update and a paint job. 

I changed into my robe and slippers, waited in the relaxation room, tried to find water, realized they were out, tried to find yummy cookie snacks like they have at Escape, realized they wanted me to eat something healthy like trail mix, and resorted to filling out paperwork. Before long, it was my turn for a facial. The bed was heated, which was amazing and my esthetician did a good job of focusing on the service and not on selling me product. At the end, she suggested some products for my skin, which added another $200 to my total, and sent me on my merry way. 

At this point in time I was feeling pretty good about the process. It's an extremely pricey place and they looked at my skin under glaring bright lights, I assumed they knew things about my pores that even I didn't know. Unfortunately, within a day, my skin looked the worst I've seen it look in a long time. And I get plenty of facials. My skin wasn't purging, it was in full blown freak out mode. Also, my skin never had that after-glow that I've come to expect from facials. One week later and my skin is completely inflamed. I've been told that it is from overaggressive extractions. I have large inflamed bumps on my hairline and between my eyebrows and in places where I've never had a problem in my life. They are not zits, they do not come to a head, they are large, red, painful places of inflammation with smaller inflammations all over my face. I'm not sure if it's an allergic reaction or if I've been told correctly and it is in fact a result of over extractions, but I know that I would never ever ever recommend this spa to someone else. My face hurts!

The worst part is that I purchased all those products while I was still happy. The spa let me bring the products back for store credit, which is a good solution, but at the same it's not. I would never go back and I wouldn't gift this type of experience to a friend. Money wasted.",helpful,1,0

My nails are bubbled, he drilled my cuticles too far back and left bits hanging off, there is crackling down one of my nails and the polish, shape and profile of my nails is completely uneven. I asked for them to be left long; he filed them so unevenly I had him give me the file so I could even them up myself and lost about half the length. They did not drill ridiculous horizontal ridges across my nails, as I had asked them not to do BUT he did drill down into my nail when he took my cuticle off. Didn't people used to use cuticle remover? My nails look fake, bulky and cartoony; the silk wraps I just took off that I did myself for the first time looked better. They also forgot to wax my eyebrows and upper lip which I was perfectly alright with by the time I left; I hate to say it but I wonder what kind of disaster that would have been. Maybe they do a better job with their regulars, but you don't GET regulars doing a manicure like this. I feel bad for the guy; it doesn't strike me as a very nice life doing nails for fussy American women (like me). I couldn't even tip the guy because ""their system doesn't allow it"" which may be the case but that's really a disservice to their employees, who are probably working for peanuts on top of not getting any tips. The receptionist was the only English speaker there, but didn't really bother to try to find out exactly what I wanted or help me decide what to get. I would think working with the same people all the time you would develop that partnership in communication but she was young and probably just didn't know any better.

We were offered a free cleaning to compensate for our past experience, and they went above and beyond to make sure that we were happy. 

A few key points:

- There was no hassle when we tried to get our free cleaning that was offered. No questions asked - they  just made the appointment and that was it.

- The guy who came to our house was respectful of not only our house, but our dogs as well. He made sure that they were safely put away before opening the door.

- The guy was very friendly and welcoming (even though he was in our house!) 

- They were quick (It took about 45 minutes to do two rooms, a landing, and about twenty stairs.)

- They did an amazing job! With two dogs, our carpets can get quite dirty...and as of now it looks like we don't  have eight little feet that sometimes don't cleaned before they make it to the carpet.

I want to say that the fact that we were offered a free cleaning shows me a lot about the company as it stands now. When we first had the bad experience, we had phoned the company and we were pretty much told 'too bad'. Of course, that just added to our disappointment of the whole experience.

In short, public relations for Alberta Carpet Cleaning has kicked it up a notch, and that tells me that they are now serious about providing amazing customer service, which is what makes a business stand out from the crowd.

The mushroom sweet potato pate was good and the cashew cheese wasn't really cheesy but it was good. My lunch date really dug the BBQ seitan sandwich. I loved the cauliflower sandwich.

1730,657855651a6d2c7052a636c2,"My now husband and I booked the Postcard Inn for our wedding. We liked the charm of the lobby, the modern and eclectic feel, and we liked that it had a vibe that could me our standards for decor. When you get married you expect everything to be almost perfect and you especially expect the venue that you are paying over $10,000 dollars to make it as accommodating as possible and it was just a nightmare. After we booked with the PCI for our wedding a few months went by and I reached out to Erin who was my point of contact at the time. I never heard from Erin and so one day I decided to call instead of Email and I was greeted by someone from corporate who said that Erin no longer worked there and I would have someone new assigned to our wedding soon. I was displeased that no one informed me of Erin leaving because it is stressful enough planning a wedding, but I let it go and waited to hear from the new hotel coordinator. Eventually I was in contact with Brianna and she was very accommodating and responsive on my emails and questions, so I thought everything was going to be okay from here on out, how wrong we were. 

Two weeks before the wedding I went to the hotel for a walk through and when we pulled up the whole front of the building where the restaurant is was under construction (please see pics) we then went inside and the ENTIRE INSIDE of the hotel was boarded up! All the charm was GONE and the elevator was not in service! My now husband and I were very upset because no one told us that the hotel was going to have construction not before we signed or after and that is EXTREMELY unprofessional! My father reached out to the general manager and he never called him back to discuss, the only thing they told us was that it was supposed to be finished by 1/15/19 but that it wouldn't be and all I can say is that if they knew that they should have told us so we weren't so shocked when we went there to have another walk through. 

Once we got to the hotel for the weekend of the weeding (all of my family from out of state stayed here as well so they made a ton of money off us for room accommodations) there was CONSTRUCTION everywhere and NOISE SO MUCH HAMMERING AND DRILLING. Our wedding was projected to be outside but due to it raining all day the day of the wedding we had to move everything inside and that made for a lot of stress but we were assured that on Sunday there would be no noise and no construction  and while there was not there was still stuff everywhere, ladders, cords hanging over walls and the complementary coffee was all gone in the morning because the construction workers drank it all. There was also a bunch of garbage lining the outside of my bridal suite which was only moved once we asked them to move it. Also, due to the rain there was leaking in the roof so there were buckets all outside of the new ceremony space and my guests had to see that. If you are looking for a place that is quiet don't come here either because when we came the music was BLASTING AT 10:00 AM and didn't end until 11:00 PM so loud it was shaking the walls and when we asked it to be turned down so my 90 year old grandfather was not disturbed that did not comply. 

Of everything that was the most disrespectful was that during the ceremony since we had to move it inside to a space that normally isnt used for a ceremony (it was right by the kitchen) ALL YOU HEARD DURING OUR CEREMONY WERE ALL THE KITCHEN STAFF YELLING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT WHAT THEY NEEDED, it is all recorded on my wedding video and I was so upset that I almost walked off the alter to ask them to be quiet, what I don't understand is that we were reassured that NO ONE WOULD MAKE ANY NOISE for our 30 min ceremony and that just was not true. 

I will say that Carrie the food manager was wonderful she really made sure the ballroom was set perfectly for all the guests, and even though I was not happy that Briana (hotel coordinator) didn't tell me that hotel was under construction she was very helpful on the day of with getting my bridal party down stairs to the ceremony because I fired my day of coordinator that morning (she was 2 hours late and already a nightmare prior to the wedding). 

Regardless, this place is not where you want to have the most important day in your life. I implore you to go somewhere else, for the rest of my life I will have people talking while I am trying to say my vows on my wedding video, it is enough to make me want to cry. Do not stay here.

A word to the wise, this place gets busy! A table for the four of us was going to be about a half hour wait (which we were very willing to wait for), but luckily a booth opened up in the lounge right away. Score.

Carlie G and I both ordered milkshakes. Mine was strawberry with a shot of cake vodka. Very tasty! Not too alcohol-y, either. Just enough to make it a delicious grown-up treat. Given the huge list of milkshake flavours and vodka flavours (30+!), I would definitely come back just to try more of the shake combos.

All four of us did a make-your-own-burger. I went with my usual combo (beef burger, plus bacon and guac) and added a chipotle mayo for kicks. As usual, it was freaking delicious. Hot and juicy!

Our server was pretty great, attentive and friendly. Overall, not a bad night. I didn't leave feeling like, ""Oh my gosh, wow, that was the greatest meal and night of my life,"" but it was pretty enjoyable and tasty.

We pretty much chose our seats sat down and waited, after a few minutes I got a high chair, and a few minutes later we got our water.  It took us a while to decide and so we just ordered a Chocolate Milkshake with espresso (5.95) although pricey this was the best thing we had all night.  Based on the pictures I ordered the caramel apple pie.  It looked like it had a good crumble style crust and caramel all over it.  And real apples filling the inside. (5.45)  I got it a la mode and warmed (1.25) ---which I didn't know until we got the bill.  My friend got the just like home apple pie (4.95) a la mode and warmed as well.  We waited a good 20 min for our food to come out.  We then waited a few more to finally have my friend get more silverware for the kids on the next table over.  Our slices of pies were all of 1 1/2 wide and maybe an inch tall. My caramel crumbly pie came out looking like some sort of pressed cake with a caramel topping.  As for warmed it was cold in the center.  Served on a much too large plate with a pretty candy syrup design the design was the best looking and tasting thing on the whole plate.  The pie was pretty flavorless for what it was.  My friends classic apple pie looked more like the picture and tasted about as expected......for frozen pie.  Water was never refilled, they didn't have anything for the kids to play with like crayons or toys and a party of 6 left because it was over 30 min and no one took their order.

With about 9 stores in Ohio, the only other state to have a Jeni's is Tennessee. You guys are so lucky. 

Upon entering, the smell of freshly made waffle cones put a big smile on my face. As we checked out all the awesome flavor combinations, it was definitely difficult to decide on what we wanted. 

On our first visit, Rachael greeted us with a smile and asked us if we wanted to try anything. She was patient and encouraged us to try multiple flavors. She kept handing us samples of flavors we didn't even ask for. On our second visit, Courtney told us we could try as many flavors as we wanted. With each sample, the ladies would also briefly describe the flavor to us. The customer service here is out of this world. These ladies made our visits to Jeni's memorable.

We finally decided on Brambleberry Crisp, Cherry Lambic Sorbet, Lemon Yogurt, Pistachio and Honey, Riesling Poached Pear Sorbet, Salty Caramel, Wildberry Lavender, and Black Currant Lambic Sorbet. 

The flavors were mind blowing. These cool treats are light, slightly sweet, smooth, well blended, and bursting with flavor. Don't think you'll like Goat Cheese with Cognac Fig Ice Cream? Ask for a sample, you may be pleasantly surprised at how delicious that flavor combo is. Smoked Tea & Plum Pudding Ice Cream sound different? Give it a whirl, it may become your new favorite flavor. 

Not ready for Cumin & Honey Butterscotch Cake Ice Cream yet. That's OK. They've got Vanilla and Chocolate too. Wait, they're called The Milkiest Chocolate In The World and Ugandan Vanilla Bean.

As of the date of this review, when you go on the Comcast Customer Service general webpage, there is a message there from Tom Karinshak, Executive Vice President of Customer Service at Comcast. His message reads as follows: ""As a Comcast customer, you are priority number one. We have a dedicated team of employees across the country working hard every day to make sure we deliver the superior experience you deserve. We are here for you. If you have a question or a concern about your service, we have numerous ways you can reach us. Please choose one that's convenient for you and connect with our team."" 

Sentence number one, ""...you are priority number one."" is the biggest lie ever. If this were true, Comcast, as a company would take receiving, addressing, and resolving customer issues MUCH more seriously. 

My experience: I recently moved into a building in which the residential portion of the building is brand new construction. By recently I mean on July 1st of this year. Today is August 2nd. We have been attempting to sign up for, and set up service in our building since the day we moved into our building. In that time, we have been told by multiple Comcast reps that our building has been surveyed and is all set up for residential internet service, several times now. We have had multiple technicians come out to attempt to install service, and every one of them has said that the building has not been wired properly. I, my neighbors, and my building owner and manager have all reached out to Comcast to try to work with them to figure out the wiring issues. EVERY SINGLE time that I have reached out to Comcast, I have had to speak to a different agent in a different department. I write down all of these people's names and the department they work in. When I call back and ask to speak with that person, it is never an option for me to be connected back to them. The problem with this is that EVERY SINGLE one of these people tells me something different about my building's serviceability, how long it will take to resolve, and what needs to be done to resolve it. Do I need a serviceability ticket? Let us set one up for you. But we can't tell you when exactly that will be completed. On another call I am told, ""we can have someone out this Thursday between 1-3 to resolve your issue."" Ok, great! The person that comes our does not know anything about and cannot resolve the issue. 
My point is that there is no accountability, and no chain of command. I have received and completed multiple surveys about my experience with Comcast customer service, and not one of them has done a bit of good. 

Comcast - Please stop wasting your money and your customers' time on pointless surveys and useless feedback calls, and put those resources toward actually servicing your customers in a prompt and timely manner. I promise you that will go a much longer way than filling out some survey that will end up in some automated inbox somewhere that no one will ever actually read anyway.

If you read this far and are STILL considering getting Comcast service, just look at the overall rating of all of the reviews on this site. If you have ANY other choice, run as fast as you can toward that other choice, and away from Comcast.",helpful,1,0

There is a reason why this is one of the most well known haunted attractions in the country if not the world.

I highly recommend getting your tickets early because as Halloween gets closer and closer, the lines to this attraction get bigger and longer. But while you wait, you are treated to such sideshows as Reverend B. Dangerous who will make your stomach turn by doing such stunts as putting a drill up his nose or lifting (and swinging) weights from his nipples. 

This isn't one of those haunted houses where you simply go through the actual house and then call it a night. You make plans to enjoy the entire evening at the House of Shock.

The pork in garlic sauce was tasty without being too spicy (at least in my opinion). It was served with noodles to help soak in all of the sauce. The dry pot dish was flavorful, spicy and the chicken was cooked just perfectly. We also really enjoyed the seasoned onions, mushrooms and other veggies that came in this dish. I'm glad we were served a bowl of rice for the table because although I tried to enjoy a low carb dinner, it was much needed to tone down the spiciness of this entree! 

Although the food was really great, I couldn't help but keep turning my head to look around at the appearance of the restaurant. I understand this location is more on the causal side, but it could really use some heavy duty cleaning and possibly even a revamp. Someone from my party and I both noticed a huge cart of dirty, used dishes propped up by the door as were making our exit. How unappetizing! We were really in awe at the fact that this was just left out for customers to see. Good thing we didn't notice this during our dinner because I'm sure it would have had an affect on our appetites. 

I might get take out from here in the future due to the fact that the food really is delicious, but you won't see me dining inside again. Hopefully the other locations are better maintained than this one.",helpful,1,0

1769,657855641a6d2c7052a6333b,"Years ago this establishment was owned by an Irish immigrant family and when they retired they sold it to another family - non Irish. But that does not mean that this place isn't still really really good. The owners were trained in all things Irish by the original family. The Irish food is authentic and I can say that because I've been to Ireland. Also, listen around to hear the Irish brogues of people who were born in Ireland and now reside in this part of the county.They wouldn't be eating here if it wasn't good. 
I've been here many many times so I truly have no idea why the previous reviewer is saying that this place is not authentic. 

The scones are as great as the ones my native Irish grandmother made and I regularly make a trip down here, approximately 25 minutes from my home just to get the scones. I've had the Irish breakfast many times and enjoyed it. The coffee is really good here. 

As far as ambience goes, well you're not going to find a lot of that here but the place is clean and the tables are set with everything you need. And the service is great. 
One of my favorite parts is the grocery section where you can get authentic Irish items. This was the first place in the county I could get that truly great Kerrygold Butter  which is better than any American Butter by far. Now the supermarkets have gotten smart and have started stocking but for years the only place you could get it was here. 

Today's stop was for Irish mustard w whisky, scones and butter. My honey marveled over the amount of authentic Irish items on the shelf here in the grocery area.

Ok, they don't have all-u-can-eat or Teppan-Yaki, but who cares, I'm here for quality not quantity.

The prices are all over the place depending on what you want.  You can drop $7.95 for bento boxes and other entrees, or the sky is the limit.  But the quality exceeds the price of every item.

The servers are genuinely sweet and caring, and do their best, and it shows.  The place is always remarkably clean, and I love the restrooms - one of a kind décor.

I think the overall success is largely due to the owners always being there - any place where there is an owner present will always live up to a higher standard than if they weren't present.

Ok - the must haves:  The Tampico Roll - a fantastic, creamy blend of avocado and heat from the spicy Kani Kama on top.  The Tuna Tataki was huge chunks lightly seared with Ponzu, just heavenly.

I ended up grabbing their Chocolate Chocolate, Oreo and Chocolate Raspberry slices. 

Something to note: The slices are basically frozen and they give you the heads up to eat them after they have been resting in room temperature for a little while. I figured my drive home (5 minutes) on a hot day would have been sufficient but when I got home it was very apparent that more time was needed. This was a bummer because we all were looking forward to enjoying them. 

Each slice was a good sized piece but were they big and tasty enough for the $9 price tag...not really. BUT as the reviews here show that's obviously an unpopular opinion AND that doesn't mean I wouldn't ever come back because I'm sure I will.

Again: Let me state, I was management at this place back in it's glory so I hold high expectations for Cutter's Mill in regards to it's employees and the state of it's location.

The employees: seem to be very inattentive, nonchalant and just rude. Never get a 'hello' when I walk in the door anymore, which used to be mandatory of all staff. I've walked around for upwards of thirty minutes without any offer of help, but listened to a staff member talk about how he was 'sooo stoned yesterday' (good for you, frickin' help me find things!!!)  

The organization is..off--there's a lack of fluidity which used to exist

I've seen stains on the faux-wood flooring which are indicative of piddle by the way it's dried (yes, I know what piddle stains look like. shut it) 

Prices just keep going up..not the staffs fault; owners Susan and Barry don't care that people are pinching pennies to feed themselves.

Also: I'd like to add that I use my phone for everything. I get emails on my phone. Most stores accept coupons sent via email on cell phones with the presentation of the coupon. Not cutter's mill. Same pineapple-express fan of an employee made me email the coupon to the store email so I could print it out. What the hell. So, I got out of line, and waited for their Microsoft Outlook to download the message, load the images, and print off the coupon.

I love the quaint, cozy atmosphere.  And I had never left disappointed, whether I came for lunch or tea, with my partner or with a large group of girlfriends.

That is, until this last time...

I am the organizer of a group of women who get together socially about once a month.  Each year, we go to Rutherford House for afternoon tea.  It's one of our group's key events, the only one to have a wait list as it's so popular.  We made our reservation for a party of 12, the most the can accommodate in their private room, seven weeks in advance.  As is their policy for groups of that size, we all ordered the same thing (one of their smaller afternoon tea packages, Hazel's Tea), and we gave the restaurant our order two weeks in advance.  At their suggestion, we moved our tea from 2:00 pm to 1:45 pm; they said that this was to better serve us.  However, though we arrived at 1:45 (one final woman showed up just before 2:00 pm), we were not served tea until 2:20 pm and we were not served any food until after 3:15 pm.  That's right, an hour and a half after we arrived!!  The tea itself was cold, bitter, and mostly gone by the time our food arrived.

The delay made two of our members physically ill:  one woman had arrived having not eaten since breakfast (she knew that even Hazel's Tea provides a significant amount of food), and the tea on her empty stomach made her nauseous, and she had to leave.  Another woman is diabetic; fortunately, she had cookies in her purse so her blood sugars did not get dangerously low.  Still how many people expect to eat their own food when they go to a restaurant?  In short, the delay in service compromised the health of two of my friends.

Now, I can understand a delay, even a delay of 1.5 hours, for a group of twelve IF we had not made a reservation.  But we had made our reservation seven weeks in advance!  We had submitted our order two weeks in advance!  They knew we were coming.  And they knew what to serve us.  They just failed to do so in a timely manner.  When I tried to talk with the servers on the day of to inquire about the delay or to express my disappointment about the service, I was rebuffed and told that they had been really busy.  I was never offered an apology.  My three phone calls to speak with a manager have gone unreturned.  Finally, I sent an email to the ""info"" email address on their website, but have not heard back from them yet.  Perhaps my star rating will change once I get some answers and assurances.

At this point, regardless of my myriad positive experiences there in the past, I am unlikely to return.  And I cannot give them a better rating than 2-stars.  The health of my friends means too much for me to give more.",helpful,1,0

I woke up today with butterflies in my stomach as I reminisced about every delicious detail. My spectacular date last night was with Reservations Gourmet-To-Go which is located in the eclectic neighborhood of Seminole Heights. Owned by Anthony and Elke Catania, it is a hidden gem that serves exquisite dishes made with local ingredients. Words can't express how much I enjoyed my meal last night. Every dish was prepared with love and passion and that is why I give them five stars.

Open Monday through Saturday from 11:30 am until 6 pm, they offer a fantastic lunch menu as well as catering. A few weeks ago they launched their Reservations After Dark with an intimate dinner service offered on Saturday nights from 6-10pm. Each week the menu is a special selection of unique dishes made with local ingredients.

My friend and I each started with a small plate. He ordered the Lobster Bisque which was savory and creamy with chunks of fresh lobster. I only had a taste, but it was spectacular and he really enjoyed it. The presentation was simple and elegant. I opted for their Prosciutto, Sweet Fig, Parmesan Reggiano, Chive and Radicchio. Every item on this dish is one of my favorites and I was really impressed with this selection. The combination of the sweet figs and prosciutto was simply intoxicating. Food porn at its best, this dish left me wanting more.

For the main course, my friend went with their Grilled Rib Steak with Jalapeño Butter. Served atop grilled bruschetta and adorned with fingerling potatoes and sautéed spinach, it was fantastic. Now, I am a medium-rare girl and he ordered his medium-well, which to me is a sin.  Nevertheless, I tried a bite and it was spectacular. The jalapeño butter was a unique blend of salty and spicy and I could not stop raving about it. It just melted into every nook and cranny and accentuated the flavor of the succulent steak. Magnifico!

I had their Blackberry Glazed Pork Chop with Blackberry Demi Glace. Served with Creamy Parmesan Polenta and Roasted Cauliflower Moutarde, it was insanely delicious. Thick and juicy, the smokey flavor of the pork blended magically with the blackberry demi glace. Fantastico!

For dessert I had their Sweetened Ricotta, Pistachio, Shaved Chocolate and Whipped Cream. Truly an orgasmic combination in a dish, it was an incredible blend of flavors. The nuttiness of the pistachio paired so well with the sweet Ricotta and I savored each and every bite. This dessert was nice and light and was the perfect conclusion to my memorable evening.

So this morning, when I finally had a morning off to go to breakfast, I knew where I was headed! Jones got an award in my book, and I'm very sad to say it was an award for ""hands down worst service I have EVER received at a restaurant"". 

Let me preface this review by saying I completely respect the job servers do. They're constantly on their feet, they get paid low and rely off their tips, and I know that's pretty hard sometimes. And I always give leniency because I know this job is hard. But this service was god awful. 

Was seated immediately upon arrival and say upstairs in a cozy two person booth. So far, so good. That's when it went downhill. Didn't see our waitress for the first 15 minutes. When she finally came over (don't know her name because she never introduced herself), she took our order to start, which was for 2 bloody marys (deliciously customized),  2 coffees, and the monkey bread appetizer. 10 minutes later, beginning to get frustrated, again, she comes over with 2 waters. We were a little confused, but thought maybe it was just protocol to also get waters. But, low and behold, 2 minutes later, she comes back and snatches away our coffee cups and our menus, too quick to even stop her. Um... I needed both of those??!?! 

Next, our monkey bread appetizer and Bloody Marys arrive, and halfway through devouring the delicious bread, we finally flag her down and ask her again for coffee, and if we can possibly order. (Mind you she took our menus so this was a little tough.) She was non apologetic but politely took our orders. She came back with coffee, and spilled the creamer all over my dates shoe. (This is the one thing that's not her fault - accidents do happen.) We helped her mop it up with our napkins, and there was still creamer all over my dates shoe when she ran off with the sopped up napkins, and what do you know, she never came back with more. And she never brought us spoons to stir the coffee, so we were at a loss here. Losses, really.

So our food comes out, so yummy looking, and I don't have silverware (or a napkin). Sat there for 5 minutes, never saw our waitress and honestly knew I never would, so my date stole me a set off another table.

This whole experience was nothing short of a DISASTER.

After getting the main entrees, she never checked on us, it took forever for her to pick up or bill... Just awful awful awful. As we were leaving the couple next to us made a comment as to how awful the service was also.

1810,657855651a6d2c7052a63c1a,"Carmo is probably built into the New Orleans dining scene business model. You come to New Orleans. You indulge in way too much to drink. You eat entirely too many heavy, rich meals. You start to gain weight. Your sweat smells sweet (that's a bonus) but you're doing a lot more of it... even for a humid place. You *need* Carmo. You need a place where you can come eat healthy to healthy-ish food and begin your detox.

So it was how I found myself at Carmo. Despite being a former New Orleans resident, I fell prey to her siren song of cheap booze and [redacted]. I was not feeling well at all and I made many more hours in front of me to pretend as though I was at all capable of working. I threw myself at the mercy of the restaurant. One thing that wasn't great for me: the lack of A/C. We sat near one of the hardest working ceiling fans in the bayou but on a day like that one, I needed ice cold cooling (and a bed. I also needed a bed). Wanting to keep it together in front of my co-workers, I opted for the restorative powers of salad and tropical (like, rain forest, can-heal-anything) juice. 

I'd had the broken noodle salad on the brain since I discovered we were heading to Carmo. However, I made a late game call and changed my mind. The Brazilian chicken salad would be what would going to coat my belly. I think I just really wanted/needed animal protein. The salad was tasty without being a gut-buster. I had a whole salad and felt full by the time I was done with it without feeling sick. That's a plus. As an added bonus, it was gluten-free! The salad's not especially fancy: lettuce base, topped with chicken, turkey, AND ham paired with raisins, peas, peppers, cucumbers, and shoestring potatoes tossed in an inoffensive cream dressing. But the star of the show was the juice. I ordered the caja (large). I'd never heard of it before. The juice itself was light orange and subtly sweet. The server said it reminded him of a mango with peach. I can't say that I picked up those notes but it was ice cold, unusual and packed with healing power (calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, vitamin B, and vitamin C). Rain forest, y'all! This is why we need to save it. Act through conscious/conspicuous consumerism and/or in-person activism. This isn't a test. Odds are, I will be hung over in public again and I will need healing juice. Don't [redacted] this up for me.

1811,657855651a6d2c7052a637b3,"The Atlantis is a hit or miss when we gamble here.  They still do temperature check before entering.  We definitely like coming here on a Friday because it is 5x slot multipliers.  My wife one time accumulated $200 dollars worth of comps on both Friday and Saturday.  For me I did around $100 dollars for those 2 nights, but we were breaking even.  Sometimes I tend to lose money quickly here, but I was never a big winner here as the most I have ever won was $250 dollars.  But the comps only applies to food, but no free play.

I sometimes get free play every 2 weeks $15 dollars and free hotel rooms during the weekday, but you do have to pay resort fee of $40 dollars I believe.  But we always stay at either Grand Sierra Resort 80% of the time and the rest 20% at the Row because both casinos usually waive the resort fee for us since we play quite a bit.

I will start with the gaming there.  The great news is the resort updates their games on a consistent basis. Every time we stop by there is usually a new machine we have not played at and we go to Reno every month or 2 months since the pandemic happened.  If they do have a new machine there is only 1 or 2 slots in there so if there is busy you have to either wait for the machine to play or play in the morning.  However, the casino is very cramped inside and you can definitely get lost with in there, but after going there for so long you learn to navigate there. Even though the games are old, I would recommend play the ""BIG HIT"" machines as it is suppose to be the machines with the higher percentage payouts.  

Key Take Aways
- Go here on the slot multipliers as you can rack up a lot of comps for the restaurants, but all depends on your budget and how much you put in the machine

- Great selection of restaurants - prefer the seafood place on the Skyway Terrance (bridge connecting to the casino) or the Purple Parrot. Buffet is opened, but the line is very long

- Easy to get lost at the casino as you can go around in the circle quite a bit

- Slot machine variety is great, different type of slot machine every time we go, however not too many of them so very limited

He did a trade in, so he couldn't take the old phone with him to make sure it's backed up. He doesn't know how to do it, but they told him they'd take care of it. So, he left his old phone and it was supposedly backing up in the store. 3 hours later it's still not backed up. They said it's too much info on the phone and it takes time. They should've warned him in the beginning that it takes time, and he'd find another way to back it up FIRST and then trade it in to them. Now we are stuck in the store, he's looking for a laptop (it's faster to back up through iTunes), so we can finally transfer everything. I understand maybe they are not supposed to transfer his info, but they should've told him about that before doing anything, because he told them he can't do it himself and he needs help. All they needed is just to sell him a new phone ASAP and get his old one for a trade in agreement (which is another rip-off program, but it's another story). They didn't care that now he's stuck with a new phone and no info on it. They got the phone and his money, now his problem is not their problem. 
Oh, and while he still was in store, he called me and I asked the lady, Tana, to take a look on the back up and tell me how much time is remaining. She said she's busy and will call me back in a few minutes. She never called me back and 3 hours later we had to go to the store. 
If someone told us right there than its gonna take hours to perform a back up (their wifi connection is very slow), I would have told my friend to wait, not to buy a phone right now.

But I liked it!~ I liked it! The rooms are so cute. All the decor and ambiance put you into the Spanish style romantic mood. The pictures of the rooms on here uploaded by them is what it really looks like not like some others that's just a tease for the customer. 

Great Location. Literally a block to the pier. 
Parking is right outside your door! (not kidding, literally) 
A little patio outside of the room that faces Castillo street (If your room is on the street side). Not recommended to walk at night because across the Inn is only a park and its pretty dark when the sun goes down. So if you are traveling with a car, its all good! 

Love the breakfast! not much but it was the little scones and cookies , coffee and bottled juices that made it! 

Free Wi-Fi, Free DVD player (that didn't work..lol) Great flat screen Panasonic TV!. I can stay in the room all day to relax if I didn't had to be out and about. 

Great and Friendly staff. The front desk guy with the beautiful bright blue eyes (I forgot his name) was fun and friendly to chat with. He gave great recommendations! 

The only one complaint I had was the walls are a little too thin.. lol. So if your neighbor comes back, you can hear their car and their conversations. But that shouldn't be too much of a bother. Not like everyone comes back at 2/3 am in the morning. 

I WILL BE BACK CASTILLO INN! Even if it's a 2 hr drive weekend getaway at your Inn! :-)

On more than one occasion, he double charged me for sides, or up charged me on the size of my sandwich, etc. I've tried to give him the benefit of the doubt (thinking maybe there was a minor language barrier), but there's no doubt in my mind now that he's just a crook. It's happened too many times. It's never been more than a few dollars, but the principle of it infuriates me. The last time I was in there, I confronted him about it. 

I've also been told by other customers that he makes them feel uncomfortable. Perhaps that's why the dining room is usually empty. The young lady who works there is very pleasant and has not tried to rip me off, but the chance that the old man (owner) is working is always enough to keep me away.

I went out to check out the Town Barker facilities with my dog. I was considering boarding him for the weekend, and the owner suggested that I come out so he could evaluate my dog and have me sign some paperwork.  I have a small dog (20 lb) male terrier mix. Upon entering the store, I gagged at the smell and had to fight the urge to vomit. The place smelled horribly of feces and urine! Giving him the benefit of doubt I continued into the store. He welcomed me, and then gave me a form to sign, a release from harm form. There were at least a dozen dogs inside a gated area. Of course they were ""exited"" at a new dogs arrival and were barking and actively running to and fro in their enclosed area. When my dog was brought into the area he was immediately  surrounded and terrified. Don was with him and was trying to introduce him to the pack, but even I know that dogs are territorial and the proper way to introduce dogs is to do it on neutral ground.  When I asked Don what the daily routine was for the dogs, when he walked them, played with them, he stated he did not do any of those things. He said they get ""free play"" all day long and he just watches them. They are not walked or exercised during the day and are allowed to defecate and urinate in the room!

A credit union seemed like the sensible choice. 

This location and the one on 107th Ave are closest to our house. I usually go to this one because the parking lot is bigger. My husband prefers the 107th Ave location. 

When I get a load of change, I like to deposit it in savings when I get a minute. It's an easy way to try to build up a little backup fund. There is one woman here who seems to grumble whenever I do it. Sorry, I thought that was part of the cashier's job...counting money. 

I just have not gotten a warm and fuzzy feeling from Servus, and my main complaint is their security method. While I'm glad that someone is attempting to alert us of fraud, I'M still the one getting screwed, but it's by them and not the criminals. 

When you use your debit card at an establishment that has had a fraud alert in the past, or there has been questionable activity there, they de-activate your card and then inform you that this has happened. Later. Unfortunately, in my case, both times they've done it, I didn't get the phone call from them until a day or two AFTER I'd tried using my card for something and had no other method of payment, which is COMPLETELY embarrassing when you're out and there's a line behind you. Everyone assumes you're overdrawn. 

The first time this happened to me wasn't as much a big deal, but when I went in to find out what was going on, they couldn't tell me WHICH questionable business I'd been to. THAT made me angry. Why is it such a secret? Just tell me so I can avoid the place in the future or use cash there. 

The second time, I had bought a book that very morning at the Goodwill location in the West End and the card worked fine. When I got down to the Bulk Barn down in the South Common an hour or so later, the card would not work. I had $200 worth of groceries in my cart, and had to ask the cashier to please set them aside so I could come back for them. I then had to go to the nearest Servus I could find (the one on 99th Street), get a new card issued, and then drive all the way back down to the South Common. I was PISSED. So it was obvious that Servus has found something weird with the West End Goodwill. Not sure if there have been skimming incidents there or what. But now I know if I go in there I need to have cash with me. 

Yesterday, I needed to get some money for parking at the ATM at this location, and the ATM was out of service, so I had to go down to 104th Ave to the ATB for $. I'm getting more and more disillusioned with Servus as time goes on.",helpful,1,0

I was starting to feel insanely hot and bothered after a quarter of the dish. Don't be fooled this is a spicy dish, maybe the spiciest pasta I've had in Edmonton. I don't think I would order it again. 

Wine list is pretty decent. I love the glasses that they are served in, they remind me of goblets!

I feel like I will come back because my friends really like this place. But it just isn't mind-blowing to me. I think because of the service.",helpful,1,0

1837,657855651a6d2c7052a6355f,"over the past couple months that i've been living in a yelp-devoid hole, i built up quite a list of places to review. and the one at the top of my list was han dynasty. i ate here a couple months ago in the dead of summer, when it was nasty humid outside and people avoided spicy foods like the bubonic plague. call me crazy, but i'll take sichuan food any day.

i've been scouring the city for a place that serves real authentic sichuan food. the kind with lots of chili oil and peppercorns, that leaves you walking away feeling like you're drooling because you can no longer feel your lips and hence don't know if saliva is dripping from your mouth or not. real sichuan food is not for those with weak stomachs, so eat at your own risk. of course, you can always ask the waiters to have the dishes made less spicy, but then you're not really eating sichuan food anymore.

my experience was mostly good. good in that this was probably the closest i've come to tasting sichuan food in the city. and all four of the dishes we had (see pictures!) were well-cooked and seasoned, and the meat was tender, so quality of food was great. however, it was bad in that they didn't serve my favorite dish (shui zhu yu- translated to water boiled fish) the way it was meant to be served. meaning in a big vat of chili oil + peppers + peppercorn. just thinking about it makes me want to hop on a plane to china right now. instead, it's served in more of a thicker broth with tofu and an assortment of peppers and garnish leaves. all i'm asking for is a liquid chili oil base with fish and soybeans. is that so hard? 

but i'm just being picky and trying to recreate one of the best dishes i've ever had. it doesn't take away from the fact that food here is still yummy and that you will leave with a tummy full of fire. han dynasty has added their own little spin to some of the dishes, and i can appreciate some culinary creativity when done right. and you may disagree with me, but in my opinion, this is the best sichuan restaurant in the city. so for that, han dynasty gets my five star approval.",helpful,1,0

1840,657855651a6d2c7052a63f9f,"Yes, the rumors are true.  This venue is over-the-top expensive.  They charge so much for food and drink that it borders on embarrassing.  There's a reason people tailgate so hard in the lot prior to the show.

As far as the lot goes, it's pretty disgraceful.  You're on the edge of Camden.  Just as shady and scary a city as there really is in America.  They try to pretty up the waterfront area and make it look nice, but the riffraff locals sneak through.  They panhandle, say lewd things and generally intimidate you until you are in the confines of the lot.  The lot is also very expensive, and the line to park your car is poorly managed.
You can chose to take the ferry from Philadelphia.  This will offer some shield from the Camden locals.  However, while no fault of the venue, that is poorly run as well.  The actual ride is a very short trip.  Roughly 10 minutes.  However rather than run the ferry constantly (every half hour would be easily doable) they choose to run it hourly.  They have no interest in making it efficient for the people.  
So, unless you're willing to skip the encore of the show and head to the departure ferry early, you'll be waiting until the middle of the night to get back to Philadelphia.
You don't like it?  Go wander well outside of the venue into beautiful Camden to wait for an Uber, or roll the dice and wander even further to the train station and hope you make it back alive.  Note: if you take an Uber to the venue, you'll be dropped off well outside once you hit the line of private vehicle traffic.  They don't have the good sense to make a separate Uber pick-up/drop-off zone.  For that matter, they haven't thought to make a drop-off zone of any kind to assist with handicapped individuals or special needs of any kind.  It's as if they simply don't want to make any effort and are there just to collect your money.

Note: Round trip on the ferry is $11 per person.  If you have a group of 4 that's $44.  If you were to Uber round trip from as far as Center City, the cost would be about a wash (maybe $10-20 more round trip for an Uber--as much as $5 more per person).  May be worth it to avoid the hastle.  Come to think of it, unless you are walking to and from the ferry from a local waterfront spot, you'll probably wind up paying for some kind of car anyway... you get the point.  Any way you do it pretty much is a hassle.

Security wasn't terrible.  I didn't see anybody getting harassed.  They seemed mainly concerned about making sure that no weapons or alcohol bottles were brought inside.  However, do go inside on the early side.  It tends to be a little slow with too few entrances/staff.  If you wait until too close to showtime, you'll be stuck in a high/drunken mob for far too long, frustrated and may possibly miss the start of the show.

The lawn is pretty disorganized chaos.  At least in the pavilion, with an assigned seat, you can claim your territory.  On the lawn, the lack of sobriety is evident and people will walk across your space/blanket haphazardly.  It's hard to fault the venue for that.  They can't possibly be expected to keep order on that level.  However, should a fight break out, they are there in a flash.  On other notes, the sound on the lawn has been vastly improved over the years, and there are several large video screens that allow you to see the screen.  However, once you get past maybe 1/3 back, sound and video are non existent.  One highlight of the lawn is the view of the Ben Franklin Bridge.  If you're lucky enough to see a show here near the 4th of July, you'll even see a few fireworks along the Philadelphia skyline.
I way prefer the pavilion.  The sound and sights are better.  There is protection from the elements.  However, the middle section (202) is simply too large.  If you are in this section and have a middle seat, you have to make your way through quite a crowd to get in/out.  If you have to use the restroom or are a bit tipsy this can be a major endeavor.  This section needs more of a center isle.

The bathrooms are a trek.  There are smaller bathrooms inside the concession areas, or there are larger bathrooms on the right and left of the perimeter.  It is a LONG walk to get there.  Unless you try to go right at the intermission, the wait times are not usually terrible.  They are sparkling clean before the show, but they don't do very much to straighten them up during the show.  It seems like they wait until the crowd is gone to clean and restock.  It's possible that they are doing things during the show.  However, it's amazing just how thoughtless and dirty a high/drunken crowd can be. 

I really enjoy visiting Philadelphia from time to time.  As a hardcore NY sports fan it kills me to say that Philly is a GREAT city.  That being said, if it's summer time and my favorite band is touring and this is the only ""local"" venue in which  they'll be performing, I'll come again.  Otherwise I'll pass.",helpful,1,0

I brought in some film to be developed, their website clearly stated ""in by noon, out by four."" This was perfect as I was leaving for New York the following morning. But when I brought my film to Bennett's BEFORE NOON I was told it wouldn't be ready until the following day unless I wanted to pay a rush fee per roll. I mentioned the statement on the website and the fellow helping me acted like he had no idea what I was talking about. I paid the rush fee (which amounted to $25) because I needed the photos developed before I left New Orleans. I actually doubted what I'd read on the website due to how the salesperson reacted when I mentioned it but I double checked the website when I got back to my laptop and sure enough there it was- in by noon, out by four. I printed out the paper and brought it back in. They gave me some weak ""well we meant 4:00 the next day"" run around. I asked where on their website does it say that. The answer ""We'll change that."" I'm sorry, but that is not how you do business. So they absolutely refused to refund me the rush fee and would not stand by the statement made on their own website. I wasn't asking for anything special only what they advertised, and this wasn't a special order, just standard cheap color film. Nowhere did it say the next business day or that there would be a rush fee. I'm a professional photographer who has relied on their services for years for my client work but if that is how they treat their customers I can't do business with them.

West Side Gravy is back in action!

To celebrate, I went there tonight for their reopening. They've kept the same menu, its just in half of the old space, which makes it cozy. All the funky food pictures and the tables are the same. 

I ordered a house salad and a meatloaf sandwich. The house salad was pretty good, with plenty of small tomatoes and cucumbers. The house dressing on it was also pretty decent. The star of the meal was the meatloaf sandwich. Perfectly cooked and accompanied by a pinot noir gravy and wrapped in delicious bacon. It was moist, flavorful and utterly delicious. I was through 3//4 of the sandwich before I knew it, it was that good. The hand cut fries were also really good.

I've eaten here a couple times before this for dinner. The steak frites and the West Side burger have been consistently good. The West Side Club however, has not. I""ve gotten burned several times with bad tomatoes. Enough times that I stopped ordering the Club because it drove me nuts having to pick out all the bad ones. 

Desserts have been hit or miss. The snickers dessert wasn't bad, but it wasn't really that substantial. The butterscotch pudding also wasn't anything that great. For $7 bucks, it should have knocked my socks off, and it didn't. The one standout was the cheesecake Napoleon. It's small but really, really good. The raspberry compote is delicious.

The place was packed when we got there.  I wasn't expecting otherwise since the airport terminals seemed crazy.  My boss and I quickly grabbed two spots at the high tables, trying to figure out what do order so we can get in and out pretty quick.

Since I practically have garlic pulsing trough my veins and as a kid have been cheek-pinched more times than I care to remember by plump old Italian women impressed by my appetite for their cooking, I couldn't wait to give them a try.
 
We were there the first week they opened and found the modest Victorian Square entry a few doors east of Great Basin Brewery leading to an open stairwell with a glass-front shop to the left. You can go up the staircase or use the elevator, but I usually prefer to subscribe to the adage that hippies use the rear door. When not entering via Victorian after saving our appetites following a visit to the coveted Sparks Farmer's Market, we prefer to park by C Street and hike the steel steps to the back entry under the low-hung telephone lines. Either way, we have always been greeted graciously and escorted to a well groomed table adorned by a flower and candle.
 
They struck me as a want-to-be fine Italian eatery that had to make some compromises to get a name and would move on from there. Understandably they couldn't have had the budget of the casinos to open a place of dazzling décor, but the quality of the cuisine and service makes up for the rudimentary decorating of the once run-down real estate. The faux painting and tile work looks like it was done by a family member, but I'm glad because it must have kept the prices lower and it adds to the rusticity. I envision them doing a major remodel some day and being the area's premier non-casino Italian eatery.
 
For a time there was a singer accompanied by his electric keyboard that I felt added real ambiance. He may not have been a high priced polished entertainer, but let's face it, I'd like to hear you do better. I've heard worse in better venues and gave them an A for effort.
 
After being seated you can always expect to receive some sliced white bread and a dipping plate of rich balsamic vinegar & olive oil. Be prepared to listen closely as the waiter introduces the specials. Sometimes after orating the names and tantalizing descriptions of seemingly endless entrées and appetizers with perfect fluidity, I almost feel like standing up and clapping.
 
On the hottest of days their AC and supplemental fans do not suffice, but the heat bothers us more than most. The perfect light fare I order when it's like this is a pair of ice cold Peroni beers, and antipasto for three. If you're gearing up for a full dinner, save room and just get the Caprese appetizer. Others we've most enjoyed include Carpaccio, Prosciutto Prawns, Calamari Fritti, and Pan Seared Scallops.
 
The entrées that top our list are Puttanesca and Linguine Frutti di Mare. Either Vitello or Pollo, I suggest the Scallopine Picatta, Fiorentino, or Parmigiana. The Seafood Cioppino really is the ""Best in Reno"" because the sauce is thick with fresh crushed tomato rather than being soupy; the delicate shellfish flavors sparkle through the hearty sauce without being beat into submission by too much saffron; and the minimal shells are manageable with just a fork so you don't have to make a mess digging into your bowl like a barbarian. If you're considering a side, their simple but carefully thought out blend of garden vegetables is sure to impress.
 
The house salad is arrives cold with a light and lively vinaigrette followed by an offering of freshly grated cheese and ground pepper that are reoffered with each course. As strongly as I despise being annoyed as I dine, I am equally impressed by the courtesy and genuine concern as seemingly every worker in the restaurant checks in with us at least once. Given that we dine early, on several occasions the chef even made a point to visit our table and further impressed me by refreshing our drinks rather than waiting for ""the help"" to do it.
 
A little heavy on the salt, but Pietro's Famiglia Ristorante Italiano will always be on our list of ""birthday week"" & ""anniversary week"" celebration stops. They first go above & beyond and then further exceed expectations by providing us with complementary port or their exquisite smooth and frigid Tiramisu (also the best in Reno). Thank you Pietro.

For some time I had heard wonderful things about this catering and meal delivery company, so I was looking forward to experiencing it for myself. I had the pleasure of meeting both Chef Cristina Gonzalez (""back of the house"") and her life and business partner, Elsa Cisneros (""front of the house""). Together as one they run this sustainable, local and organic-focused business. 

To begin, both women are extremely talented and experienced. Chef Cristina attended the School of Culinary Arts at SBCC and then later worked under Wolfgang Puck and for Bon Appetit. On the other hand, Elsa focused on catering at Philip's College in San Antonio, later to find herself at Bon Appetit elbow-to-elbow with Cristina. 

Next, viewing the exterior of where Daily Greenz shared kitchen is located is unassuming. However, after entering you quickly realize that this is home to one of Santa Barbara's cleanest kitchens. Everything from the ovens to the pans were sparkling clean and new.

Daily Greenz Pop-Up allowed me the opportunity to taste a few items. To begin, there was a refreshing Jamaica ""Blood"" Tea (for Halloween) and a perfectly-balanced Margarita. They provided a fresh Caesar Salad as a starter, followed by a choice of two tacos. The tacos included Achiote Chicken (refried beans, caramelized onion, cheese, and avocado-tomatillo drizzle) and Pork Chile Colorado (Pork Palace Heritage Pasture pork, refried beans, and queso fresco). Both tacos were small and bite size, yet huge and full of delicious flavors. Each ingredient could be tasted individually and enjoyed immensely.

I learned and appreciate that Daily Greenz gives you the option to reserve your chef-created meal service between 48 hours to 2 weeks in advance. Not only that, they allow you to choose a flexible meal plan for lunches/dinners (either or both) for one to every day of the week.

We had a brief falling out after I saw Sweeney Todd, but we're back on good terms now that Sam Jacobson, meatpie whisperer extraordinaire, has redeemed them for me, and put them back in their rightful place, a place of adoration.

Stargazy is exactly what the neighborhood needed, a solid place to get a delicious meal or snack for a reasonable price. I've now tried the following,  and I won't rest until I try everything on the menu (the menu changes daily so I'm in it for the long haul).

Traditional beef and onion: flavorful, yet simple, hearty and perfect for cold weather. 

Lamb curry: got this to go and it was still heavenly even reheated. Hefty portion of meat and great flavor.
 
Pumpkin habanero chevre: not your ordinary pumpkin pie. Savory and not too spicy. 

Mash and parsley liquor: parsley liquor sounds weird but you will find yourself wanting to lick the plate to get the last remnants. Pro tip: save some pie crust and use it to sop up the last remnants. Mash is delicious and the perfect comfort food. 

Banoffee tart: tart, toffee, bananas, and whipped cream.  A wise Gwen Stefani once said: This shit is bananas, BANANAS. There's a good chance she was referring to this tart.

Sticky toffee pudding: warmed up and served with a hefty dose of heavy cream. Like a gingerbread cookie on crack. Best choice we made of the day. 

Apple and Apricot tart: like Apple pie but better, also had heavy cream poured into a little crevice. 

Free tea: donations accepted for local charities. 

Fancy crisps: crisps are what Brits call chips, and Stargazy has an assortment of exotic crisps for sale! Tried Prawn Cocktail which was good. There are also various other British snacks for sale. 

Seating can be a challenge but there's a little park across the street that would be the perfect spot if you don't snag one of the few (pie pun engraved) tables. If you do grab a table,  don't linger too long,  people are waiting. This place is as hot as its pies right now,  if you come anytime after opening,  expect a line, a wait for fresh pies, and several items to be out. Look out for a star on the bottom of your pie- it means you won a free pie! Check their instagram for daily menu and to make sure they're not sold out. Sam has also used the instagram as a lost and found, which is adorable.  There's no point calling because they don't have a phone (who would answer it,  they're to busy slinging pies).

1879,657859931a6d2c7052a656d7,"As a restaurant, this place seems reasonably priced, bordering on cheap (given the gourmet quality of the food), but as a bar, it seems a little on the pricey side, but that's how I feel about most of the Philly bar scene.  This place's atmosphere is more bar than restaurant, but it delivers quality food and would be a fine place to go eat even if you were not drinking anything.

VERY good beer selection.  Pretty sizeable, and pretty top-notch choices available, showing some evidence of careful selection.  It's not the normal sort of beer to go with Mexican food but I think most of the beers here are chosen to mesh well with the particular style of food served here.

About the food:

I would not call this place ""Tex-Mex""...I've had a lot of Tex-Mex and I would describe this as like, what you get if you start with more authentic Mexican and take it in a different direction.  For example, if you order tacos, they'll come out in soft corn tortillas, with raw cilantro and onion, and a lime on the side, just like Mexican-style.  But the minute you bite into them, you'll realize that they've used a completely different way of seasoning the meat.  Their Al Pastor?  Pork and pineapple, just like the real deal, but the minute you taste it you realize it's been developed into something completely new.  Not exactly authentic, but artful and delicious, a worthwhile form of cuisine in its own right, and definitely influenced by, and congruous with Mexican food.  And also harmonious with the beers served here, which have a range of styles but tend on the stronger and more intensely aromatic side.

But little here, neither the food, nor the beer, is at all reminiscent of the flavors of Tex-Mex, so I find that categorization misleading.

Why not five stars?  It's just not my scene, and this in one of those places where the ambiance is a bit pervasive, saturating.  So, while I can really enjoy this place, especially the food, beer, and even enjoy the setting a bit, I don't think I'd ever truly feel 100% at home here.",unhelpful,0,1

Plenty of hot food is available for a break from the cold selections, most notably from the hibachi bar. Thus far I have not bothered to try it, quite possibly because I keep getting sat on the side nearer to the sushi. By the time I get anywhere close to the hibachi, my plate is overflowing with sushi and I have no room on it for hot food. You know, one of those good problems.

The restaurant is located at the corner of Race Track Road and Countryway, just to the west of the Sweetbay Supermarket. It's in the small strip mall facing Race Track Road along with some other restaurants and bars.

On a rainy Monday night, there was no waiting and hardly anyone inside of the restaurant, but the telephone to-go orders were flying in fast and furious. I sat at the sushi bar, as I often do to interact with the sushi chef and watch his technique. It got busier as the evening went along, but the noise level stayed at a low ""hum"" due to the high ceilings and the peaceful sound of their water wall fountain.

The food is amazing, and just as good as the original location in Ybor City. I was pleased to see that the menu is the same, and I knew that I'd be in for a terrific meal.

I started with a seaweed salad that was served in a large martini glass over a bed of shredded carrot and turnip, and drizzled with sesame seed oil. Then I moved on to the Tempura Lobster Roll which is clearly the very best thing that I've ever eaten. I added the Spontaneous Combustion Roll which was a perfect blend of salmon, shrimp, initation crab, asparagus, avacado, scallions, and smelt roe, wrapped with grouper and then baked with spicy mayo. I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese, so I asked the chef not to include that in my roll, and he was more than accomodating.

My friend ordered the Blue Moon Roll which has lump blue crab meat, asaparagus, and scallions with a teensy weensy bit of cream cheese. She also had the Tuna Summer of Love Roll which was spicy sesame tuna, mixed greens, scallions and smelt roe, and all wrapped up in rice paper.

What a great little shop on Market Street. Beautiful chocolates line the immaculate cases while staff, dressed in old fashioned garb, patiently wait and answer questions from people like me who stand there gawking at the chocolates. I may have thrown in some bad jokes about how I could never work there because I would eat everything. 

Anyway, what struck me as slightly unusual is that everything I saw was priced per piece and not per pound. This was perfect for me, though, because I only wanted two or three pieces anyway so I could sample items I know I love -- mainly, anything with caramel and/or sea salt. So, even though I spent like $4 on three pieces of candy, it was worth it.

I ordered the sparking rose, 1/2 dozen oysters and Jesse & I split the toasts. The oysters were served on a bed of rock salt with cucumber mignonette. The oysters had great flavor and were perfectly shucked. The light sauce complimented the salty oysters nicely.

We showed up promptly for our 8:30 Dinner reservation, then proceeded to wait to be seated until 9:30. One hour wait, with a reservation? We found it strange, too.

Half hour into our wait, we find out they actually sat ANOTHER party under our reservation. Have I mentioned yet that no one has even attempted to apologize for any of this yet?

After an hour, they tell us they are ready for us. They take us down to the private party room, where we see that all tables are full and no one looks slightly ready to wrap up their meal.

We proceed to wait in a cramped hallway causing complete havoc for another 15 minutes or so. We finally sit down, feeling like sardines as we squished through this narrow hallway while the other massive party leaving attempts to exit as we enter. They immediately chucked frozen bread onto our table. Yes, the bread was frozen.

The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of one is because my meal was good, as were the others, especially the Gnocchi and the Tilapia dish. They did make an error on one dish and my friend didn't get to eat until we were all practically finished. I had the Risotto Primavera. Portion sizes were very generous and everything was served hot, unlike the bread.

Now comes time for the bill. Prices were reasonable and in splitting it up evenly among 17 people, we all paid $30.  (Thank you, BYO!)

We all had cash accept one friend, so she provided her card. The waiter comes down a few minutes later after collecting our cash only to tell my friend that he had made an error and charged the entire $500 meal to her credit card but they would obviously reverse the charge. Really?! They were completely unapologetic and everyone on the staff we spoke with kept saying it ""wasn't their fault"". That's like, the first lesson taught in the no-no's of customer service.  I will just assume there was no manager present on a busy Saturday night, because no one said anything to us at all about all of the inconvenience.

I told her that I couldn't fathom having these fried lashes for a minute longer, so I got eyelash extensions to cover them up. The first set was amazing, they lasted about 3 and a half weeks. I went to get them done again and each time that I went back for a fill (about 5 times) they got worse and worse. They put WAY TOO MUCH glue on, and because of this, when the eyelashes fall out (like they should naturally), they come out in chunks of 5. They also do not attach one false lash to your natural lashes. They attach three which make them very heavy. Here was what my eyelashes looked like after a week and a half......

Reserved a car from Tampa Airport. I chose ""Lock low and go"" which is described as: Book now at a rate equal to a Compact car and we guarantee you a Compact car or larger vehicle. Declined added insurance as my credit card provides full coverage.

When I got to the counter the agent informed me that the car available was a Chevy Spark, which she said was very small and implied would not be very comfortable or safe. She offered an upgrade for $15/day. 

I told her that the ""Lock low and go"" program was supposed to be a compact car or larger, not an economy car. She told me the Spark was all she could give me at that rate. I reluctantly agreed to the upgrade as I didn't want to be in such a small car.

The agent then asked ""if I wanted to upgrade from the standard insurance?"" I told her I did not. 

Upon returning the car I realized that I was charged about $15/day for insurance along with the $15/day for the upgrade. I needed to make my flight so was unable to argue at the time. When I got home I checked the Dollar website and saw that the Chevy Spark was indeed an economy car, and that the compact choices would have been fine. I was sold an upgrade for no reason.

I called Dollar and after waiting on hold for 20 minutes told the representative what had happened with both the upgrade and the insurance. She quickly told me that she was not at the counter to verify my story and that the upgrade charge would stand. She further told me that I accepted the insurance. I explained that was not how it was worded by the agent, and that I told the agent I wanted to leave it as I had reserved it.  She informed me that the charges would stand.

It's dirty. And out of date. And depressing.

Staff didn't know the answer my questions re: walk-in appointments until checking several times.

You may not get the service you actually wanted. 

The have inadequate equipment. 

Their no-show policy is HARSH and complicated to understand. They even say ""Subject to change during premium periods"" with no explanation of when a premium period is or what the EVEN HARSHER policy is. 

Save your money for something worth spending it on because this place IS NOT WORTH IT.

I scheduled a mani/pedi through the website, and when asked to pick my services, there was no option for ""gel"", but the site said this was an option. I planned to tell the technician upon arrival.

When I arrived, I explained I wanted the gel option, and I was told my 2 hour appointment wouldn't allow for this option. This was disappointing, as the website didn't offer directions to indicate this as my preference. 

Classic mani/pedi it was. The mani didn't dry, even after sitting at the out of date drying station for 10 minutes. What a waste of time and money. 

This being said, my experience with Stephanie the tech was great, so I scheduled another appointment, this time for a gel manicure. 

But the closer the date came, the more I dreaded the appointment. May I suggest you tour the facilities before making an appointment or buying a gift card for a loved one? 

The salon is out dated, not well-cleaned and has a depressing atmosphere. 

I admit it. I no-showed to my next appointment. I anticipated what I understood to be a $25 no show charge. 

BOY WAS I WRONG. They charged me $118 - more than my appointment was supposed to be (I had locked in a promotional rate). 

I WAS CHARGED FOR OVER 100% OF A SERVICE CHARGE WITH NO SERVICES RENDERED.

Also, the ARE accepting walking. If no one walked in for an appointment during a Saturday, I wouldn't be surprised, therefore it's understandable as to why they charged me for 100% for services not-rendered. The business is failing, perhaps?

I let the owner know that I had a really questionable Philly steak sandwich. The meat was barely chewable and tasted like it had gone bad.

Even during a test run, it's clear that no small amount of thought, planning, training, and practice went into every element of Vida. Reinventing the building that was Amici, you walk in to face a wall garden of myriad greens, some familiar and some new, that will be gracing and filling many of the dishes that await you. The service is friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable -- you get the feel that everyone on staff is as acquainted with the food as the chefs. Often when servers tell me about the food, I feel like I'm being fed lines. Not so, here. There's a sort of pride and unity felt throughout all dialogue I had with staff that keeps a customer seeking more. 

At the same time, Vida is unpretentious. I walked in with the expectation that I would feel outclassed by the food. In actuality, I definitely was, but even so, the entire environment was warm and approachable, which I've come to expect from Hoosier chic. This is the type of food that would be found at the best restaurants in our largest metropolises, but the ingredients and the hospitality are wholly Midwestern. 

That's to say nothing of the food, of course, which knocked it out of the park. Every bite was ingenious, with twists and turns on familiar fare and some things that were brand new to me. The house pastry chef designs the breads, which are all complex and diversely textured. I had the ""Wall Greens"" salad, which literally comes from the greens on the wall and tastes as crisp and fresh as a salad can be. It's a gorgeous space to eat in, but the food is certainly the centerpiece of Vida.

I've been looking forward to Vida's opening for months. I'm so glad it's finally arrived.",helpful,1,0

Got here for happy hour and had some of the most questionable raw oysters any of us had ever experienced. I can't complain a whole lot as I was the only one who actually finished my dozen but my two friends each ate about 6 of theirs before they couldn't stomach it any longer. We managed to each snag quite a few of the $3 happy hour drinks which helped to deter a 1 star review and our bartender, Anthony, was fantastic and very patient with us. We all ordered our food and got to waiting. Took FOREVER. One of our crew got chips, salsa, and queso....queso came and it was burnt. How do you burn queso? I mean it probably has directions on the individual packets telling you how long to put it in the microwave. Then 5 minutes later the salsa came (eye roll emoji). The food eventually came and it was decent....for most of us. Same friend who had the burned queso, also, received some burned Mac and cheese. Anthony took it back and got her a fresh one, which was great of him to do. At that point the rest of the night went relatively smooth. Food was decent, as I mentioned, and Anthony kept slinging drinks our way as needed. Then we cashed out and went to leave....as we were walking down the stairs to leave we saw a large cockroach on the stairs. The girls about lost it.

The setting inside is beautiful and classy, yet very casual at the same time. The servers are very kind and cheerful.

The wines - I had a glass of Weingut Max Ferd Richter Riesling, and a glass of Moscato D'asti dessert wine. Both wines were superb.

Appetizer - I had the New Orleans BBQ'd shrimp that was served with the most delicious, creamy sauce, and French Bread.

For dinner - A nice portion of Filet and a very generous portion of Lobster Tail. The BEST. The Lobster was served with browned butter, that almost tasted like caramel. The Lobster was sweet enough that I didn't even need the butter. The meal also came with very tasty garlic mashed potatoes.

I rented one of the two Chalets, which has a private garage, indoor heated pool, Jacuzzi tub, steam room, massage chairs, and sound system throughout, for our anniversary. The check-in time was 6 pm, and we arrived at 5:55 pm. I was greeted quickly by the front desk staff and was told that it would be five more minutes before our chalet would be ready. After waiting 10 minutes I returned to the office and was told that it would be a few more minutes. At this point, I returned to our car frustrated because we had traveled over five hours and were now delayed in getting into the chalet to kick off our anniversary celebration. However, several minutes later, the staff at Sybaris displayed their customer-centric approach.

When the young lady came out to our car with the chalet garage door opener and gate access code she apologized for the delay and extended our check-out time by an hour. I didn't ask for it nor had we hinted at wanting anything. Rather, the staff was focused on customer satisfaction and made things right. At this point, my frustrations dissipated. Upon walking into the chalet our jaws hit the floor. It was spacious, clean and beautiful. The pool area had lots of room and there was also a pool slide. As we brought our personal belongings upstairs we walked past the steam room, which was also spacious. The bedroom had plenty of accent lighting around the bed, from the floor to the ceiling. There were separate controls for each set of lighting, which allowed us to pick & choose the lighting and added to the mood.

As an added touch, the cleaning staff had created towelgami of two swans kissing and had placed them on the bed. Next to the bed was a gas fireplace that certainly added to the ambiance, and next to it was the Jacuzzi tub. Also, there were two massage chairs by the glass overlooking the pool area that had fresh robes laying on them. The room also had a coffee maker, refrigerator and two wine glasses. The bathroom was clean and spacious as well. The area outside of the bathroom had his & her sinks with plenty of mirror space. The sound system was fantastic and provided good sound in the pool area and in the room. We hooked our Apple & Android phones to it easily without any problems.

There are a number of wine stores and restaurants close by in case you forget something or need nourishment. Also, delivery is available if you decide not to leave the property. We made good use of the later check-out time that was offered and hated to say goodbye because we had such a wonderful time. Upon checking out, I turned in the comments card they provided at check-in and assumed it would find its way onto someone's desk and die a slow death. However, I was wrong. The employee that took the card read it right away and took note of the concerns I had about the A/C unit in the chalet. She quickly apologized and offered us some wonderful, complimentary items when we return to any Sybaris. This was another example of their customer-centric focus. 

Unfortunately, having been on the road for over four hours and closing in on our home I realized that I had left some clothes behind in the closet in our room. It was July 4th so I wasn't sure what kind of assistance I would receive. I called and spoke to an employee and she said that she would get hold of the Head Housekeeper right away in order to secure my clothing. She called a short time later to say they had my clothes and would gladly send them to me. I'm happy to say that a few days later my clothes arrived back at home.

From start to finish, the staff was wonderful to deal with and was always focused on customer satisfaction. Based on the customer focused experience we had, and based on the beautiful accommodations, my wife and I are already talking about returning to one of the Sybaris locations. We, without a doubt, recommend Sybaris to anyone.",helpful,1,0

Spinning has always been sort of a love-hate thing for me, but I think I realize now it's because instructors in my past have been a little.... dull.

I want to start off by saying that the only reason that I did not give this business a five is because of price ( therefore other than that has aspect they deserve a 5).

This restaurant  has a similar menu to Chipotle where you make your own bowl. I ordered a kid's bowl with an extra veggie because of price and the bowls only came with one veggie and two protein options (which I thought was weird); so that is why I added the extra veggie. The base to my bowl were the sweet potato noodles (made out of sweet potato starch) and on top I got barbecue chicken, brussel sprouts, eggplant and some green balsamic vinaigrette dressing on the side. I must say that up until this point in my life, I had not eating eggplant that I enjoyed but this eggplant was amazing; I might even say it was the star of the dish. The bowl was a good size, I left full. I really appreciate how this restaurant offers seriously healthy choices (good enough for those who are watching their figure, the only thing I would watch out for is sodium).

Located in a nice area within a neighborhood of Townhomes, this restaurant has a fairly young, hip vibe to it. It is very casual but nicely decorated; the good windows and great location made it perfectly sunlit. As I said before the only downside is the price. I paid almost $10 for my kid's bowl; while I don't think that is expensive I have to say that is not what one expects to pay when eating from this type of ""fast food"" restaurant (especially for a kids meal.

Obviously you're picking from a limited menu, but between the three courses you can try a good mix.  I would recommend actively designating your spice preference or you won't see a single chili.

My first two courses were great other than a lack of spice.  Steamed shicken (shrimp/chicken) dumplings with a tangy soy dipping sauce and and a Tom Kha soup readied the palate for an even greater entree - Chicken Pad Kra Pow.  All the flavors came to town, but I was served up a plate with spoiled meat.  I could taste it and smell it.  After already having tolerated my waiter's lecture about Thai spice being different than Indian spice - because I'm brown and only eat CTM all day - it took some finesse to convince him the truth.  He eventually talked me into trying their Orange Chicken instead of getting the same despite the PKP being delicious.

Deep fried chicken fingers in a light orange glaze with a side of steamed broccoli.  The glaze didn't do anything for the oily batter and you guessed it... bad meat.  2.5 courses and a bite in, I had enough.  Check please.

Crew is always friendly, work is done quickly. On the days when they get really busy, they call and let you know if your job is going to be delayed. I've also had tires here, with the road hazard warranty, and that has definitely been a great value. Paid for itself the first time I had to replace one of the tires I bought there. I've found the staff to be very honest, and give you some good tips to get the most out of your vehicles performance. The location is also really convenient as I can just pop over to the mall or catch a movie if need be. 

The only downside is they have to give you the corporate spiel and sales pitches every single time you come in. I'm on a first name basis with multiple staffers here, but they are still required to go down the list of offers you aren't going to want. That's more a Sears corporate problem than it is a problem with the staff here. As it is, they have my business.",helpful,1,0

It took several calls to cancel ... they won't do it via email or online chat, and their phone customer service is abominable -- repeated sparkly music and sugary voice saying how important their subscribers are, as you wait for a half hour or so for a person to pick up.  First time we called to cancel, once we finally got through to a human we got disconnected as soon as we said we were cancelling.  Of course they didn't call back though they had our phone number.  

The paper's quality has dropped repeatedly over the years, though we still enjoyed Tully and some of the other writers.  But the final straw for us was the erratic delivery.  Our carrier apparently takes frequent days off without arranging a substitute, so our neighborhood just doesn't get papers on those days.  Calls to report the missing papers were burdensome for us and frequently ineffective; we often did not get the promised credits to our account.  We were always told the problem would be reported up the chain, which tells us how much the guys up the chain care about customers.  Last Monday the paper contained a coupon for free admission to the State Fair.  When we didn't get the paper, we were promised that edition would be delivered the next day, but of course it was not.

1988,657855651a6d2c7052a63d87,"I'm really surprised to see low star reviews. I didn't look at the reviews before stopping in here and I'm glad I didn't. At only a few stars I may not have stopped and what I had was yummy and will bring me back again. 

I was looking for a quick lunch, as I work nearby, and didn't want fast food. I came in hoping for a bagel or muffin or something quick. When I saw the menu I noticed they had a breakfast burritos and served them all day. 

The owner greeted me as I walked in and jumped behind the counter to start my order. While my burrito was made to order he whipped up a blended vanilla latte type coffee drink for me. Perfectly caffeinated and not too sweet - exactly what I needed to get me through the rest of the day.

The burrito was ready promptly (not immediately but it didn't feel like too long of a wait) and I was already sipping on my coffee by then. I paid easily, grabbed the fruit that was included with my burrito and headed on my way. 

Back at the office I opened up a delicious burrito with potatoes, eggs, cheese and bacon. The side of salsa was yummy and added an extra layer of flavor to the burrito. I was really surprised it was squished so flat it could double as panini. Not the typical burrito of my breakfast experiences but still super tasty!

For the price ($7) I thought the burrito was a good deal. I will say the coffee was about the same price as the burrito and that seemed pretty expensive to me.

Oddly enough, I would come back for the food but not the coffee.",helpful,1,0

Looked up Metro Diner and heard it was the best breakfast place in St. Petersburg ... let me tell you what ... the food is amazing! But even better yet, we were helped by Kiki ... the best server on the planet! She enthusiastically greeted us like a World Class Ambassador of Goodwill. Enjoying a good meal is only as good as the experience created by the person attending to you. Kiki clearly loves what she does, as she made the great food even better with her attentiveness to making sure everyone was having a great experience.

I had the Cinnamon Pancakes (YUM!!!!), along with a bacon, egg and cheese croissant. My wife, Niki, had fried chicken and waffles which was lights out incredible!

How a restaurant can make comfort food like this taste so incredible is beyond me ... we have this back home in Austin, but it doesn't come close to this.

Thank you, Kiki, for a wonderful experience ... and thank you, Metro Diner for the incredible meal and the terrific ambience you have created that makes every employee here love what they're doing!

Thumbs up to you guys all the way!!!!",unhelpful,0,1

Bf and I were a bit skeptical since there was no yelp reviews an only one review from an unknown website. I told my bf that I trusted the green island owners taste since they were from Cali.

Outside plaza looked run down but as I walked in I was surprised with the cute and clean decor. As we get the menu my mouth started and kept drooling over the pictures of the yummy food.

Now the most important information... How good or fresh was the fish? I wouldn't say top of the line, but it was goo and fresh enough for me to want to drive 10 miles south for it! :) they had a lot of different rolls and the sashimi was fresh. 

When we got our bill it was $50! Not bad for all the food we ordered (about 7 dishes?) :)

It took 45 minutes for our appetizers to come out. The edamame was over cooked and mushy while the spring roll did not look appetizing almost like it was frozen. I could buy better spring rolls from trader joes.
Next we moved on to our sushi which was sat on the sushi bar for 15 minutes before it was brought to us. The sushi it self was good, but not the best I have ever had,

1997,657855651a6d2c7052a63d89,"I had a quick get together with a couple of friends and they decided to get a couple of pizzas delivered from Swarthmore Pizza. 

First, they ordered around 10 pies. Most of the pies they got were plain, but they also ordered a few pies with other toppings including pepperoni and mushrooms. I decided to have a slice of the mushroom pizza. 

When pulling a slice of pizza out of the box, I was delighted by how easily it broke off. However, I was quickly disappointed after seeing how greasy the pizza was. Further, I felt as if the flavor of the pizza was nothing spectacular either. The cheese and sauce was fine, but nothing popped out. Also, the pizza was fairly doughy and the crust was a bit dry and bland. I did like how tasty and fresh the mushrooms were. 

Altogether, Swarthmore Pizza serves a solid pizza, but nothing truly stands out about it.",helpful,1,0

I drive back with my receipt and showed the guy which he immediately gave me attitude although I was being polite which I don't appreciate what's so ever. Then he called the manager which was the girl that took my order to my surprise her names Yolanda. You'll think she would make things right but no all I got was more attitude and told me she told me she couldn't do anything about it then walked away, like what ? After asking where she went for several minutes the other manager came out and he fixed things like they should have been at the beginning. I highly don't recommend to come here at night or order from them anytime pass 7pm not only am I not hungry anymore my food is cold and just the whole situation leaves me not wanting to came back to this store again.
